Currently, a female under 18 may have an abortion with no notice to her parent or guardian. The bill includes detailed requirements for the notice, including that the minor’s doctor must provide the notice at least 48 hours before the procedure. This waiting period would be waived if a parent or guardian gives consent. The bill also allows the minor to go to court to authorize an abortion without giving notice to her parent or guardian. The minor could ask the court to excuse her from school to attend the hearings and to have the abortion. The court could direct the school not to tell the minor’s parent or guardian of the minor’s pregnancy, abortion, or absence from school. The bill allows a minor who is a victim of abuse by her parent or guardian to get an abortion without notice or consent. To do this, the minor and an adult relative or authorized official with personal knowledge of the abuse must sign a notarized statement about the abuse. The bill would make it a felony for a doctor to knowingly violate the statutory notice provisions for giving the minor’s parents notice of the minor’s intent to have an abortion. The bill sets out a doctor’s defense for performing an abortion without first providing notice or obtaining consent where the minor faces an immediate threat of death or permanent physical harm from continuing the pregnancy. Doctors who perform abortions on a minor would have to submit reports. This bill amends a law passed by the legislature in 1997 that is on the books but which may not be enforced because of a Court decision. The 1997 law was known as the “Parental Consent Act.” This bill makes changes to the 1997 law to address concerns in the Court decision and seeks to make the law, as amended, enforceable.",Ballot Measure 2,Initiative,Abortion,Primary,0.561,Statutory,1

140,Arizona,2000,Constitutional Amendment Relating to Creation of a Redistricting Commission,"(summary from Arizona Legislative Council)<BR>  Proposition 106 would amend the Arizona Constitution to establish an appointed Redistricting Commission to redraw the boundaries for Arizona's legislative districts (for the members of the Arizona Legislature) and to redraw the boundaries for the Congressional Districts (for Arizona's members of the United States Congress).

Political party registration, voting history data and residences of incumbents and other candidates may not be used to create district maps.<BR>  7. ""Competitive districts"" are favored if competitive districts do not significantly harm the other goals listed.<BR>  <BR>  The Redistricting Commission would consist of five members, no more than two of whom can be from the same political party or the same county.

An owner could request that the value of their primary residence, including a single family home, condominium, townhouse or mobile home and up to 10 acres of undeveloped accompanying land, remain fixed by applying for a ""property valuation protection option"" with the county assessor.  The county assessor would grant the option if all of the following requirements are met:<BR>  <BR>  1. The owner is an Arizona resident.<BR>  2.

143,Arizona,2000,Constitutional Amendment Relating to State Lands,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  <BR>  (summary from Arizona Legislative Council)  In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state.  The Enabling Act granted Arizona millions of acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"".  The state land trust is intended to produce revenue for various public institutions (schools, colleges, prisons, etc.), the largest of which is the public schools which own 87% of the land.  The state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, only to the ""highest and best bidder"" at public auction.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 100 proposes a series of amendments to the state constitution that, together with changes to the Enabling Act, will allow some state trust land and trust land income to be used for additional purposes as follows:<BR>  <BR>  - Proposition 100 would allow public school trust land to be donated to a school district without cost for use as a school site. The school district could only use the donated land as a site for kindergarten, elementary, junior high or high school instruction.<BR>  - Approximately 270,000 acres of state trust land could be designated as Arizona Conservation Reserve (ACR) lands to preserve significant cultural, historical, paleontological, natural resource or geologic features from development. A city, town or county would nominate trust lands to become ACR lands and, after review, the Legislature could designate the nominated land as ACR land either by passing a bill or by referring the nominated land to a statewide vote of the people. ACR land could be sold for its appraised value minus the development value to a state agency or to a city, town, county or Indian tribe without an auction, but any owner of ACR lands would have to protect the unique features of the land from development. Proposition 100 includes approximately 70,000 acres at 41 trust land sites that are proposed to be designated automatically as ACR lands. A list of these initial ACR lands appears at the end of this analysis.<BR>  - State trust land could be exchanged only for other government-owned land and only to conserve open space on the trust land. In order to permit the exchange, it must be in the best interest of the state land trust, there must be public hearings, the appraised value of the land the state receives in the exchange must at least equal the appraised value of the trust land the state exchanges, the state trust income must not be reduced and the financial impact of the exchange on the county, city or town and school district in which the lands are located must be analyzed. This change does not require an Enabling Act change by Congress.<BR>  - The Legislature would be authorized to provide that in cases where trust land is being sold for development, additional trust land could be donated to the community for conservation purposes if including the conservation land in the package deal would increase the overall net value of the trust land to be developed.<BR>  - Up to 5% of the money derived from sales and leases of trust land could be appropriated to manage trust lands rather than being paid to the trust beneficiary institutions. The money could also be used for land use planning, but could not be used for personnel expenses. <BR>  - The Legislature would be authorized to allow agricultural and grazing trust land to be leased for long term (more than ten years) without an auction in order to promote sound stewardship and long-term agricultural and grazing productivity. <BR>  - Natural products of the trust land, such as rocks and plants, could be sold in small quantities for noncommercial purposes without an auction.<BR>  - The state trust land auction process would be expedited by reducing the time between the date of the auction notice and the date of the auction and by allowing the Legislature to determine how the notice and the auction is to be conducted.<BR>  <BR>  Approximately 70,000 acres of trust land will be designated as Arizona Conservation Reserve Lands if Proposition 100 is approved. The actual boundaries of these parcels are shown on maps filed in the office of the Secretary of State.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, the location and boundaries of these sites are shown on maps at the Arizona state land department website:  www.land.state.az.us/alris/proposed/propinfo.html",Proposition 100,Legislative Referendum,Natural Resources,General,0.48700000000000004,,0

Currently, the Arizona Constitution requires a simple majority vote for initiative measures.  The two-thirds requirement would also apply to measures authorizing or restricting (1) the methods of taking wildlife (2) the seasons when wildlife may be taken.

145,Arizona,2000,Consumer Choice and Fair Competition Telecommunications Amendment,"(summary from Arizona Legislative Council)<BR>  The Arizona Constitution gives the Corporation Commission the authority to prescribe all local telephone service rates, charges and classifications.  In practice, the Corporation Commission sets the rates and charges for incumbent providers through a formal process, and regulates the rates and charges of new local telephone companies through a less formal process.  Proposition 108 would amend the Arizona Constitution to allow all companies that provide local telephone service to set their own rates, charges and classifications for local telephone service in any city, community or other area in this state if the Corporation Commission determines that local telephone service is available from two or more companies to a majority of the residential or business consumers within that specific area.  This proposition does not apply to long distance telephone service or to access and interconnection charges paid by one telecommunications company to another.   If an area is served by two or more companies that provide local telephone service but a consumer has access to only one company, that company would be required to offer the consumer the same rates for comparable local telephone and other telecommunications services offered by that company to other consumers in the area, and the Corporation Commission would be required to establish a ""simplified and expedited"" process to allow consumers to enforce their rights to those comparable rates.<BR>  <BR>  In areas of the state where only one telephone company is offering local service, the Corporation Commission would continue to set rates, charges and classifications.  Proposition 108 would amend the Arizona Constitution to change the methodology used by the Corporation Commission in setting local telephone rates. Currently, the Arizona Constitution requires the Corporation Commission to use the ""fair value"" method in setting a utility's rate base.  (The rate base is the value of the facilities and other assets needed to supply utility service to the consumer.  The ""fair value"" method involves adjusting the original cost of the plant and additions upward to recognize increased costs in constructing utility plant facilities.)  A utility's rate base is then used by the Corporation Commission to set end-user rates.  This proposition would delete the constitutional requirement that the Corporation Commission use only the ""fair value"" method for telephone and telecommunications services and would allow the Corporation Commission to use fair value, rate caps and other rate making methodologies in setting those rates, charges and classifications for those services.  In setting rates, charges and classifications under this proposition, the Corporation Commission could consider only the costs arising and revenues derived from telephone and telecommunications services provided in areas where rates are regulated, not areas where rates are deregulated.<BR>  <BR>  Under this proposition, each telephone company that provides local service would submit an annual report to the Corporation Commission specifying the areas in this state in which the company is offering local telephone service to residential or business consumers, or both.  Companies could then submit petitions to the Corporation Commission requesting that their own rates in areas served by competing companies be deregulated and determined by competition, rather than being set by the Corporation Commission.  The Corporation Commission would have to deregulate local telephone rates in an area where it determines that a majority of consumers are being offered service from two or more companies.  The Corporation Commission would be authorized to deny any petition if it decides that local telephone service is not generally available from competing companies.  If the Corporation Commission did not act on the petition within 60 days of filing, the area would be treated as if competitive services were generally available and rates would be deregulated in that area.  The Corporation Commission's determinations on deregulating rates in an area would be made separately for residential and business consumers.  All determinations would be subject to review in court.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact Summary:<BR>  Proposition 108 would amend the Arizona Constitution to allow telephone companies that provide local service to set their own rates and charges in areas of the state where competition exists.  It is not possible to determine in advance the impact of the Proposition on Arizona's economy and on state government tax revenues.  As a general practice, deregulation of an industry leads to more competition and lower prices than in the previously regulated market.  Moreover, increased competition is often associated with additional business spending and employment growth, which in turn tend to raise the general level of economic activity and state tax revenues.<BR>  <BR>  In this particular circumstance, however, we cannot accurately predict the extent to which the telephone industry would become deregulated under the Proposition.  Once the magnitude of deregulation becomes known, the fiscal impact will become easier to determine.<BR>  <BR>  Finally, subsequent to deregulation, the responsibilities of the Corporation Commission and another state agency, the Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO), relative to rate setting should decline, and their budgets will need to be evaluated at that time.<BR>  [CA]",Proposition 108,Initiative,Telecom & Info Technology,General,0.196,,0
146,Arizona,2000,English Language Education for Children in Public Schools,"(Summary by Arizona Legislative Council)<BR>  Proposition 203 would repeal the existing bilingual education laws and change the law to require that all classes be taught in English except that pupils who are classified as ""English Learners"" will be educated through sheltered English immersion programs during a temporary transition period.  The sheltered English immersion programs will provide nearly all classroom instruction and materials in English, but may use a minimal amount of the child's native language when necessary.  The temporary transition period for sheltered English immersion programs will normally not exceed one year.  When an English learner has acquired a good working knowledge of English, that pupil will be transferred to a regular English language classroom.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 allows parents to apply for waivers from participation in English immersion programs if their child already knows English, their child is at least ten years of age or their child has special needs.  If the school grants the waiver, the child will be transferred to classes that teach English and other subjects through traditional bilingual education instruction or other generally recognized educational methods that are permitted by law.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 allows parents or legal guardians to recover actual and compensatory damages and attorney fees, but not punitive damages, against persons who willingly violate its provisions.  Any school official who willfully and repeatedly refuses to comply with Proposition 203 is personally liable for damages and attorney fees to the parents or legal guardians of the child, shall be removed from office and shall be prohibited from holding any position of authority in the public school system for five years.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 requires that all students in grades two through twelve be tested annually to monitor their progress in academic subjects and in learning the English language.  Students who are classified as severely learning disabled may be exempted from this test.  The test score of an individual pupil compared to the national average will be confidentially provided to the parent or legal guardian of that pupil.  The combined test scores for schools and school districts will be published on the Internet and the aggregate scores achieved by pupils classified as ""limited-English"" will be listed in a separate sub-category.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact Summary:<BR>  Proposition 203 requires pupils who are ""English learners"" to be taught in English immersion classes during a temporary transition period.  Under current law, school districts receive extra funding from the state for ""English learners"" without a specific time limit.  Because the Proposition would limit the amount of time that pupils could remain eligible for additional state funding for ""English learners,"" the Proposition is expected to lead to state savings.  The amount of the savings is difficult to predict in advance as it depends on the number of pupils who learn English more quickly in the immersion classes.  In addition, it is unclear how federal law would affect the transfer of students out of the immersion classes.  The maximum state savings would be as high as $20.3 million in 2004 if all English learners become proficient in English within a year, although that outcome is unlikely.<BR>  <BR>  An additional fiscal impact could occur if school districts had to revamp their curricula, staff assignments, and operating procedures in order to comply with the Proposition.  Since it would alter neither the state funding formula for public schools nor laws that ""cap"" school district expenditures, any additional costs would require a reallocation of existing school district resources.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 203,Initiative,Education: PreK-12,General,0.63,,1

148,Arizona,2000,Relating to Local Growth Management Plans,"(Summary from Arizona Legislative Council)<BR>  Proposition 202 would change existing growth management statutes to add additional requirements including that all counties and cities and towns having populations of 2,500 or more would have to adopt ""growth management plans"" in addition to the plans already required under existing law that include specified environmental and growth regulations.  A required element of each growth management ordinance is the drawing of ""urban growth boundaries"" within the incorporated boundaries of the county or municipality.  The boundaries could be no larger than necessary to allow ten years worth of population growth, based on state agency (Department of Economic Security) population projections.  Outside the urban growth boundaries, development of homes or businesses requiring rezoning of property to a higher density and extension of water, sewer and other public services to landowners would be prohibited except where it could be shown that ""extraordinary and compelling circumstances"" warrant an exception and the exception is approved by a four-fifths supermajority vote of the governing body, and if the exception is more than 20 acres, the exception is approved by the voters at an election.  The boundaries may not be expanded unless the state agency population projections allow for it and the change is approved by the voters.  The growth management plans must also ensure compliance with federal and state air and water quality standards and not unreasonably burden the supplies of surface and groundwater.<BR>  <BR>  The additional growth management plans must be adopted in each county, city and town by January 1, 2003 after public hearings and approval by the local voters.  Until January 1, 2003 or the date on which the plan is adopted, counties and municipalities are prohibited from approving new commercial or residential subdivisions or rezoning of land to a higher density use without a four-fifths supermajority vote of the members of the governing body.  The local voters could use the initiative process to adopt or amend a growth management plan.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 changes existing law to permit any person, regardless of residency in the community, to file a lawsuit against any other person, including any local community, public official, public employee or private party alleging violation of Proposition 202 and seeking injunctive or other relief.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would change existing planning and zoning law in other respects:<BR>  <BR>  - Existing law allows counties and municipalities to assess development fees for the cost of public services required by that development including water, sewer, streets, public safety, parks and public administration facilities.  Proposition 202 would require counties and municipalities to assess additional fees for the full cost of all provided public facilities including, but not limited to, mountain preserves and mass transit.<BR>  <BR>  - A number of existing county and municipal planning and zoning procedures would be repealed, including elements of municipal general plans and county comprehensive plans, as well as the standards for imposing a development moratorium.<BR>  <BR>  - Each general plan and comprehensive plan (the existing growth management plans) would have to conform to the additional growth management plan required by Proposition 202, and adoption of each general plan or comprehensive plan or major amendment would require a three-fourths supermajority vote of the governing body.<BR>  <BR>  - Proposition 202 also proposes numerous changes to existing county and municipal planning and zoning procedures to increase public control over how land is used and developed.  Counties would be given authority to regulate ""wildcat subdivisions"" outside of cities and towns, including lot splits (into two or three parcels) and subdivisions (into four or more parcels).  State land held in trust for funding public schools and other public institutions in the State of Arizona would also have to comply with county and municipal land use plans and growth management plans, and priority would be given in state land use plans for maintaining state lands in a ""natural"" state, without development or alteration by humans or livestock, to the maximum extent allowed by the state constitution and Enabling Act.<BR>  <BR>  There is an existing program for preserving undeveloped land owned by the State of Arizona, and $20 million in state grants per year is available for that purpose.  Each grant of state money must be matched by private donations.  Proposition 202 would use that money to preserve other qualifying public and private ""natural areas"", in addition to state land, and eliminates the requirement that applicants provide matching money.  Organizations participating in the program would have to have the primary purpose and sole and exclusive motivation of conserving the natural environment or preserving natural open space.  This measure removes the requirement that lands that are purchased or leased through this program be open to public access except to protect and preserve natural ecosystems or other rare and unique features.  This measure eliminates monies available under this program for conservation based livestock or agriculture management, and current provisions under the program for existing leases on state trust land sold or leased for conservation.<BR>  <BR>  This measure eliminates the requirement that landowners consent to rezoning of their land when such rezoning restricts their use or reduces the value.<BR>  <BR>  This measure eliminates the prohibition against government entities denying reasonable access to private property.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact Summary:<BR>  Proposition 202 would require cities and counties with populations over 2,500 persons to develop growth management plans by January 1, 2003.  The fiscal impact of this Proposition will depend on how these growth management plans are implemented.  The precise form of these growth management plans will not be known for several years.  As a result, it is not possible to predict the Proposition's precise impact on the state economy at this time.<BR>  <BR>  If the creation of the growth management plans results in less development in the long-term, the Proposition would probably negatively affect the state's economy and state and local government revenues.  Slower development would cause declines in the construction industry.  This could lead to lost state and local revenue from taxes on the construction industry.  This same negative impact could also occur in the short-term if the approval of the initiative delays the start of new development projects. <BR>  <BR>  If the Proposition channels development into specific geographic areas without slowing growth, the fiscal impact is more difficult to predict.  The more limited geographic opportunities for development would probably increase land prices.  Higher land prices could increase property tax collections, but could also lead to a reduced demand for development.<BR>  <BR>  The growth management plans could generate local government savings as developers would be required to pay the full cost of infrastructure development, such as streets and sewers. If developers are not currently paying these full costs, this provision would increase local revenues.  The developers, however, could pass these additional costs along to consumers or businesses in the form of higher prices.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, local governments could realize efficiency gains if construction is directed inward where services such as police & fire protection are already provided.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 202,Initiative,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.298,,0
149,Arizona,2000,Relating to Sales Tax for Education,"Referred by the Legislature<BR>  (Summary by Arizona Legislative Council)  Proposition 301 provides for:<BR>  <BR>  1. An increase of six-tenths of one per cent in the rate of state transaction privilege (sales) tax, and an increase of six-tenths of one per cent in the state use tax for twenty years.  An increase of six-tenths of one per cent changes the state's current rate from 5.0% to 5.6%.  This equates to an increase of 12% to the state's rate.  If Proposition 301 passes, state general fund expenditures would be an additional $94.5 million in 2002, increasing annually thereafter.  These additional expenditures would not be paid for from the increase in the sales tax.  The uses of the new revenue are for the following purposes:<BR>  <BR>  (a) To authorize and pay for issuance of up to $800 million of new school improvement revenue bonds to correct existing deficiencies in school buildings.

150,Arizona,2000,Relating to Use of Tobacco Litigation Monies for Certain Healthcare Programs,"(Summary by Arizona Legislative Council)<BR>  In 1998, the attorneys general of 46 states, including Arizona, agreed to settle a lawsuit they had filed against the manufacturers of tobacco products.  As a result, the tobacco manufacturers must pay each of those states a portion of the estimated $206 billion settlement each year over the next 25 years.<BR>    <BR>  Arizona's share is estimated to total approximately $3.2 billion.  Payments are subject to annual adjustments for inflation.  The settlement also includes a provision to reduce payments if the volume of cigarettes sold in the United States falls.  The settlement agreement allows each state to determine how it will spend its share of the settlement.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 204 would require Arizona to deposit all of the money it receives over the next 25 years from the tobacco litigation settlement in the ""Arizona Tobacco Litigation settlement fund.""  Money in the fund would be used to increase the number of people who are eligible for coverage in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), which is the state's health care system for the poor.  Currently, there are many eligibility categories that determine if a person can receive health care under AHCCCS, including one that requires that a recipient's net income not exceed approximately 34% of the federal poverty level.  If Proposition 204 passes, people who earn up to 100% of the federal poverty level will qualify to receive health care under AHCCCS.  Future legislatures could change the eligibility requirements to allow more people to qualify to receive health care under AHCCCS but the Legislature and the AHCCCS administration could not reduce or limit the number of persons who would be able to enroll in AHCCCS.<BR>  <BR>  Any excess monies in the Arizona tobacco litigation settlement fund would also be used to ensure that programs that were previously established by the passage of a proposition in the 1996 general election would be fully implemented at funding levels that, when adjusted each year for inflation, would be at least equal to those provided for in that election as follows:<BR>  <BR>  1. Five million dollars for the Healthy Families program, which provides services to prevent child abuse and neglect and to promote child wellness and proper development.<BR>  <BR>  2. Four million dollars for the Arizona Health Education System to provide scholarships to medical students who agree to practice in areas of the state that are currently underserved by health care professionals.<BR>  <BR>  3. Three million dollars for programs to prevent teenage pregnancy.<BR>  <BR>  4. Two million dollars for disease control research.<BR>  <BR>  5. Two million dollars for Health Start, a program that aims to reduce the incidence of low birth weight babies and childhood diseases and to educate families on the importance of good nutrition and preventive health care for their children.<BR>  <BR>  6. One million dollars for the Women, Infants and Children Food program.<BR>  <BR>  Under the 1996 proposition, all of these programs have had to rely on distributions from lottery revenues. However, this has proven to be an insufficient source of funding for these programs.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact Summary:<BR>  Proposition 204 allocates monies received from tobacco companies as part of a lawsuit settlement.  The state is expected to receive between $92 million and $109 million annually through 2006.  By 2025, the state is expected to have received $3.2 billion in total tobacco settlement revenues.

Proposition 200 will prohibit Arizona's counties from suing the tobacco companies to recover tax monies expended by the counties for indigent health care expenses from tobacco-related illnesses.  It would also require the counties to turn over to the Healthy Children Healthy Families Fund any sums they recovered from tobacco settlement monies.  The fund would also include 70% of the money that is collected by current Arizona tobacco tax revenues.  In so doing, Proposition 200 will divert existing tax revenues generated from the tobacco tax without an offsetting reduction in mandated programs previously funded by such taxes.  The proposition would also require an annual general fund appropriation of $28 million to fund four programs currently funded by current Arizona tobacco tax revenues.  This may result in a need for additional taxes or other revenue sources.  All of this money would be distributed as follows:<BR>  <BR>  1. Twenty-one percent in the ""Smart Beginnings Prevention Account"", which could not exceed $35 million in any one fiscal year.

Three hundred fifty thousand dollars each fiscal year in the ""Oversight and Enforcement Account"", which the Attorney General would use to enforce the master settlement agreement and this proposition.<BR>  <BR>  4. Three hundred fifty thousand dollars each fiscal year in the ""Auditor General Account"", which the Auditor General would use to conduct annual financial audits of the use of money distributed from the Healthy Children, Healthy Families Fund.<BR>  <BR>  Any money that remained in the Healthy Children, Healthy Families Fund would be transferred to the ""Health Care Coverage Account"" for distribution as follows:<BR>  <BR>  1.

The state treasurer would also deposit in this subaccount any money that remains in the Health Care Coverage Account at the end of each fiscal year after all required distributions are made.  The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Administration (AHCCCS) would use subaccount money to ensure that the maximum number of eligible children are served in the Children's Health Insurance Program, to pay for certain organ transplants, to provide HIV/AIDS medication and for outreach programs.  The proposition amends the AHCCCS statutes to provide for expanded coverage and the AHCCCS administrator could use monies in the subaccount to cover these additional administrative and program costs.<BR>  <BR>  2. Fifteen percent in the ""Annual Health Subaccount"", which could not exceed $20.5 million in any one fiscal year.

The Department would use the remaining money to provide crisis stabilization and residential treatment services to children who have serious psychiatric impairments.<BR>  <BR>  5. Three percent in the ""Older Arizonans Subaccount"", which could not exceed $3.5 million in any one fiscal year.  AHCCCS would use 85% of this money to provide care to older persons who are suffering from chronic diseases and whose social security coverage is otherwise insufficient.  The Department of Economic Security would use the remaining 15% to fund nonmedical home and community-based care programs for the elderly.<BR>  <BR>  6. A total of $75 million in the ""Mental Health Facilities and Services Subaccount"".  The state would use this money to construct and renovate mental health facilities and to provide mental health services.  Any money that remained in this subaccount at the end of four fiscal years would be returned to the Healthy Children, Healthy Families Fund.<BR>  <BR>  7. A total of $30 million in the ""State Medical Laboratory Subaccount.""  The state would use this money to build a state medical laboratory.  Any money that remained in this subaccount at the end of three fiscal years would be returned to the Healthy Children, Healthy Families Fund.<BR>  <BR>  8. An amount sufficient to ensure that the ""Health Crisis Fund"" would maintain a balance of $1million.  This fund was enacted into law by the Legislature in 1997 to deal with any potential health crisis and consists of money raised from Arizona's tax on tobacco products.<BR>  <BR>  This proposition would also:<BR>  <BR>  1. Repeal and reenact, word-for-word, the statute that established the current tobacco taxes.  By doing this future legislatures would be prevented by the Arizona Constitution from making any substantial changes to the taxes that are collected from tobacco products in this state.<BR>  <BR>  2. Amend Arizona's current Children's Health Insurance Program (Kidscare) to ensure that benefits under that program are identical to the health benefits Arizona now provides to AHCCCS children.

As part of the tobacco company settlement, the state is expected to receive between $92 million and $109 million annually through 2006.  By 2025, the state is expected to have received $3.2 billion in total tobacco settlement revenues.  In addition, the Proposition reallocates $108.1 million of existing revenues received from the state tobacco tax in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002.  When tobacco tax and tobacco settlement revenues are combined, it results in approximately $200 million to $216 million per year in funding for health care and family support programs starting in 2002.<BR>  <BR>  In addition to allocating the tobacco tax and tobacco settlement revenues, Proposition 200 specifies that certain health care expenses currently funded by tobacco tax revenue are to be funded by the state's general revenue source.  Therefore, Proposition 200 will result in an annual cost to the state of $28.0 million from its general revenues starting in 2002.

A cardholder would be entitled to possess, use or produce two ounces of marijuana and two marijuana plants, and the cardholder's designated primary caregiver would be entitled to possess or produce two ounces of marijuana and two marijuana plants. The registry identification card program also includes the following provisions:<BR>  · Under certain conditions, the Department of Health Services would be allowed to issue a registry identification card to a person who is less than eighteen years of age if the person's custodial parent or legal guardian consents to the medical use of marijuana by that person.<BR>  · The Department also would be allowed to deny an application for a registry identification card if the applicant fails to provide the necessary information or the Department determines that the information provided is false.<BR>  · Intentionally providing false information to the Department for purposes of obtaining a registry identification card would be punishable as a class 4 felony.<BR>  · A cardholder and the cardholder's designated primary caregiver would be required to return their registry identification cards to the Department if the cardholder's attending physician determines that the cardholder no longer has a debilitating medical condition or if the cardholder no longer resides in Arizona.<BR>  · Any person who possesses a registry identification card would have to notify the Department of any change in the person's name, address, attending physician or designated primary caregiver and annually submit to the Department updated written documentation of the person's debilitating medical condition and name of the person's designated primary caregiver for the upcoming year.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 defines ""debilitating medical condition"" to mean cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or treatment for these conditions; a medical condition or treatment for a medical condition that produces, for a specific patient, one or more of the following: (i) cachexia; (ii) severe pain; (iii) severe nausea; (iv) seizures, including but not limited to seizures caused by epilepsy; or (v) persistent muscle spasms, including but not limited to spasms caused by multiple sclerosis; or any other medical condition or treatment for a medical condition adopted by the Department by rule or approved by the Department pursuant to a petition submitted pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute section 36-2611.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 would increase the maximum sentence by fifty percent for any person who is convicted of intentionally and knowingly committing a violent crime while under the influence of a controlled substance and would abolish the minimum mandatory sentence or fine for any conviction of certain drug offenses.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 would require probation on conviction of a first or second offense involving the personal possession or use of paraphernalia associated with possession or use of a controlled substance and prohibit the court from imposing a term of incarceration in prison or jail as a condition of probation. It would subject to incarceration persons who are convicted of three or more offenses involving personal possession or use of a controlled substance or paraphernalia associated with possession or use of a controlled substance. For purposes of determining whether or not a person is eligible for probation or incarceration, a court could not consider a prior conviction for personal possession or use of a controlled substance or personal possession or use of drug paraphernalia associated with possession or use of a controlled substance if the person has completed a court ordered drug treatment or education program for that prior conviction. Proposition 203 also specifies that any drug treatment for a person with a history of opiod use must include an assessment by a professional who is qualified in the use of narcotic replacement treatment and, if medically necessary, must include use of narcotic replacement therapy, such as methadone maintenance.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 provides that even if a person does not possess a registry identification card, the person would have an affirmative defense to a criminal charge of possession, usage or production of marijuana if the person charged has been diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition, has been advised by an attending physician that the medical use of marijuana may mitigate the symptoms or effects, is engaged in the medical use of marijuana and possesses or produces not more than two ounces of marijuana and two marijuana plants. If the person possesses or produces more than these amounts, the person could also assert the affirmative defense but would have to prove that the greater amount is medically necessary as determined by the person's attending physician.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 would also require parole or community supervision for prisoners who have been convicted of personal possession or use of a controlled substance and who are not concurrently serving another sentence, unless the Board of Executive Clemency determines that a prisoner would be a danger to the public. These prisoners would be required to participate in and, to the extent they are able, pay for a drug treatment or education program as a condition of parole or community supervision.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 specifies that property seized in relation to a drug offense may not be forfeited unless the owner of the property is convicted of the drug offense and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that either the property was instrumental in committing or facilitating the offense or was the proceeds of the offense.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 203,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.42700000000000005,,0
154,Arizona,2002,Education Expenditure Limitations,"(HCR 2002)<BR>  Analysis by Legislative Council:<BR>  <BR>  The Arizona Constitution requires the Economic Estimates Commission (EEC) to annually establish an aggregate expenditure limitation of local revenues for all Arizona school districts. The EEC calculates the aggregate expenditure limitation by adjusting the base level   expenditures of local revenues to reflect changes in the student population and cost of living.  The Constitution prohibits school districts from spending more than the aggregate expenditure limitation established by the EEC. The Constitution excludes certain revenues from the definition of local revenues, thereby making those monies exempt from the aggregate expenditure limitation.<BR>   <BR>  In 2000, the voters approved a ballot measure increasing the state transaction privilege (sales) tax and allocating the additional revenue derived from the increase for various education purposes. The additional revenue is subject to the aggregate expenditure limitation.

The Act made several changes to laws regarding drug-related crimes. The current law states that in most cases, a person who is convicted for the first time of personal possession or use of a controlled substance is eligible for probation and is not subject to incarceration. In addition, as a condition of probation, the offender must attend a drug treatment or education program. If the offender violates probation, the court may impose additional conditions of probation, including intensified drug treatment, community service, intensive probation or home arrest, but may not impose a term of incarceration for the probation violation. Additionally, a person who has been convicted three times of personal possession or use of a controlled substance may be sentenced to a term of incarceration or may be eligible for probation pursuant to other statutes in effect.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 302 would expand current law so that a person who is convicted for the first time of personal possession or use of drug paraphernalia is also eligible for probation and drug treatment and is not subject to incarceration.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 302 would allow a court to impose a term of incarceration on a person who is on probation for a first offense involving personal possession or use of a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia but only if the offender violated probation by committing another drug-related offense or violated a court order relating to drug treatment.<BR>  <BR>  This proposition would also allow the probation department or a prosecutor to petition the court to revoke an offender's probation if the offender fails or refuses to participate in drug treatment while on probation. If the court revokes probation, the offender would be sentenced under Arizona's drug laws. In addition, any person who has been convicted of personal possession or use of a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia, regardless of the number of prior convictions, would be subject to incarceration and would not be eligible for probation if the person refuses drug treatment as a term of probation or rejects probation as a sentencing alternative.

160,Arizona,2002,School Trust Land Proceeds,"(SCR 1005)<BR>  Analysis by Legislative Council:<BR>  <BR>  In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state. The Enabling Act granted Arizona millions of acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"". The state land trust is intended to produce revenue for various public institutions (schools, colleges, prisons, etc.). The largest beneficiary of these revenues is the public schools. The state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, only to the ""highest and best bidder"" at public auction.<BR>  <BR>  Revenues earned from state trust land are classified as either permanent or expendable. Revenues derived from the sale of state trust land and the sale of natural products are deposited in a permanent fund by the State Treasurer and invested in stocks, bonds and other interest-bearing securities. The investment income from the permanent fund and the income from leases are expendable revenues for use by the state trust land beneficiaries. Funds are kept separate according to the designated beneficiary.<BR>  <BR>  In 1998, the legislature enacted a law that requires the expendable revenue from the permanent state school fund to be used in the following order of priority: (1) to pay the debt service on state school facilities revenue bonds, (2) subject to legislative appropriation, to fund new school facilities and (3) to fund basic state aid to schools. In 2000, the legislature capped the amount that could be used to support any of these priorities to the fiscal year 2000-2001 level and provided that any expendable earnings that exceeded the fiscal year 2000-2001 earnings level would be placed in a separate fund called the classroom site fund.

161,Arizona,2002,Senior Citizens' Property Tax Valuation,"(HCR 2038)<BR>  Analysis by Legislative Council:<BR>  <BR>  In 2000, a majority of the voters approved a ballot measure which amended the Arizona Constitution to allow qualifying senior citizens to freeze the value of their primary residences for property tax purposes. To qualify for the property valuation protection option, the property  owner must be an Arizona resident who is at least sixty-five years old, must have lived in the residence for at least two years, and must have an income that does not exceed 400% of the supplemental security income (SSI) benefit rate. If two or more persons own the property, the  owners' combined income may not exceed 500% of the SSI benefit rate. Qualifying property owners must reapply for the protection option every three years.<BR>  <BR>  Since the implementation of the 2000 ballot measure, there has been some confusion over the proper income level to use when two or more persons own a property. The Social Security  Act prescribes two SSI benefit rates: a benefit rate for individuals and a benefit rate for two or more persons. Under the 2000 ballot measure, it was unclear whether the qualifying income level of multiple owners should be 500% of the SSI benefit rate for individuals or 500% of the  SSI benefit rate for two or more persons. In 2002, the qualifying income limit for multiple owners is $32,700 when using the SSI benefit rate for individuals and $49,020 when using the SSI benefit rate for two or more persons. By specifically referring to section 1611(b)(1) of the  Social Security Act, Proposition 102 clarifies that the qualifying income limit for multiple owners would be determined by using 500% of the SSI benefit rate for individuals. Therefore, under Proposition 102, multiple owners who have an income that exceeds $32,700 would not be  eligible for the property valuation protection option.  Proposition 102 also clarifies that property owners must apply or reapply to the county assessor for the property valuation protection option on or before September 1 of the applicable year. The assessor must notify the resident whether the application is accepted or denied by  December 1. If the property owner files the application after September 1, the assessor shall process the application for the following year.",Proposition 102,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.8009999999999999,,1

The state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, only to the ""highest and best bidder"" at public auction.<BR>  <BR>  In 1936, Congress amended the Enabling Act to give Arizona more flexibility in managing and disposing of trust land by allowing the state to exchange trust land for other public  or private lands. The state never amended its Constitution to incorporate that authority for land exchanges, but the state did enact statutes to provide for these exchanges of land. Acting under its statutory authority, the State Land Department has periodically exchanged state trust land  with the federal government and with private landowners. In 1990, the State Supreme Court determined that without amending the Arizona Constitution the state cannot conduct land exchanges. Subsequently, the State Land Department ceased the land exchange program.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 would amend the Arizona Constitution to allow the state to exchange state trust land only for other public land and only if the exchange is in the best interest of the state land trust and the exchange conserves open space on the trust land offered by the state. In  order to permit the exchange, there must be public hearings to provide for public comment on the proposed exchange, the appraised value of the land the state receives in the exchange must at least equal the appraised value of the trust land the state exchanges, the state trust income must  not be reduced, the financial impact of the exchange on each county, city or town and school district in which the lands are located must be analyzed and the physical, economic and natural resource impacts of the exchange on the surrounding community and local land uses and land  use plans must be analyzed.",Proposition 101,Legislative Referendum,Natural Resources,General,0.488,,0

A majority of voters approved the continuation in 1998 and the Arizona State Lottery is now scheduled to terminate on July 1, 2003.<BR>  <BR>  Article IV, part 1, section 1 of the Arizona Constitution prohibits the Legislature from amending any ballot measure approved by the voters at or after the November, 1998 general election without a three-fourths vote of each house of the Legislature. Accordingly, the Legislature may only extend the termination date of the Arizona State Lottery with a three-fourths vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, a majority of the voters (rather than a three-fourths supermajority) may vote to extend the Lottery’s termination date. With Proposition 301, the State Legislature is again asking the voters to decide whether to continue the Arizona State Lottery. If the voters approve Proposition 301, the Arizona State Lottery will be scheduled to terminate on July 1, 2012.

165,Arizona,2002,"Tribal-State Gaming Compact, Scholarship and Elderly Care Act of 2002","Analysis by Legislative Council:<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 200 directs the Governor to enter into tribal gaming compacts allowing Indian tribes to operate slot machines and card and table games on tribal land.  Tribes would contribute 3% of ""annual net income"" (defined as the annual total amount of money collected from Class III gaming, less any annual amounts paid out as prizes or paid for prizes awarded and annual labor and other operating expenses and annual interest expenses, depreciation and amortization) to the state to fund university, community college and tribal college scholarships, programs benefiting senior citizens, tribal education purposes and tribal elderly health care services. These distributions are  outside the regular legislative process.<BR>  <BR>  Arizona has entered into gaming compacts with 17 of the state's 21 Indian tribes.  These compacts permit the tribes to operate specific gaming activities, including slot  machines, that are, according to a federal court decision on appeal, illegal off of Indian reservations. These compacts begin to expire in the summer of 2003.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 200 directs the Governor to enter into a new gaming compact with each Indian tribe that requests it. All compacts must have the following provisions:<BR>  · Term - 20 years. May be extended for an unlimited number of additional 20-year terms at the request of the tribe.<BR>  · Facilities - Each tribe may operate 3 gaming facilities. The tribe and the Governor may agree to authorize additional facilities.<BR>  · Games - Tribes may offer all forms of gambling legal under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act including slot machines, card and table games including blackjack, poker, roulette, craps and baccarat, wagering on horse and dog races, lottery games, bingo and keno. Each tribe may operate 1000 slot machines or the number of machines that the tribe currently operates (whichever is greater) and may operate 20 gaming tables at each facility. Tribes may offer keno games at no more than 2 facilities unless the Governor and tribe agree on a greater number. The number of slot machines allowed increases each year based on changes in the state's population.<BR>  · Transfer provisions - Tribes may transfer a portion or all of their slot machine allotments to other tribes.<BR>  · Revenue - Each tribe must contribute 3% of the tribe's net income from gaming to the Arizona College Scholarship and Elderly Care Fund. Monies are distributed to universities, community colleges and tribal colleges for scholarships, to programs throughout the state that benefit senior citizens and to Indian tribes to be used for educational purposes and for elderly health care services. In addition, each tribe must pay an annual fee of $500 per slot machine to the state to reimburse the state for  administrative costs incurred in relation to Indian gaming.<BR>  · Disclosure - Each tribe's contribution to the Arizona College Scholarship and Elderly Care Fund is confidential, but the Arizona Department of Gaming may make public  the aggregate contributions from all tribes. The Director of the Arizona Department of Gaming also must annually disclose the amount of money collected from the tribes  as administrative costs.<BR>  · Regulation - Gaming facility operators must keep surveillance logs that are open to inspection by the Arizona Department of Gaming, but no other records are subject to Department of Gaming inspection, including financial and accounting records. Tribes must investigate reported compact or tribal gaming ordinance violations and require gaming facility operators to correct violations. Tribes must notify the Arizona Department of Gaming within 48 hours when a violation is reported. Tribes must license gaming employees who are not enrolled tribal members.  Tribes must also license each manufacturer and supplier of gaming devices and each person providing gaming goods and services in excess of $50,000 in any single month. The state must certify nonenrolled tribal members who are involved in gaming or financial activities, manufacturers and suppliers of gaming devices and persons providing gaming goods and services in excess of $50,000 in any single month. The tribal gaming office is authorized to conduct investigations of compact violations. The Department of Gaming has access to tribal gaming office reports but is not authorized to conduct independent investigations.<BR>  · Results of Statewide Expansion of Gambling - If state law changes to allow anyone other than Indian tribes to offer slot machines or card and table games for profit or if the state imposes any additional assessments related to gaming on Indian tribes, the tribes no longer have to make payments for regulatory costs or to the Arizona College Scholarship and Elderly Care Fund and the limitations on slot machines and card and table games become null and void.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 200,Initiative,Education: Higher Ed,General,0.152,,0

173,Arizona,2004,State Lands,"SCR 1012<BR>  In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state. The Enabling Act granted Arizona millions of acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"". The state land trust is intended to produce revenue for various public institutions (schools, colleges, prisons, etc.). The state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, only to the ""highest and best bidder"" at public auction.<BR>  <BR>  In 1936, Congress amended the Enabling Act to give Arizona more flexibility in managing and disposing of trust land by allowing the state to exchange trust land for other public or private lands. Arizona did not amend its state Constitution to incorporate that authority for land exchanges, but the state did enact statutes to provide for these exchanges of land. Acting under its statutory authority, the State Land Department has periodically exchanged state trust land with the federal government and with private landowners. In 1990, the State Supreme Court determined that without amending the Arizona Constitution the state cannot conduct land exchanges. Subsequently, the State Land Department ceased the land exchange program.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 100 would amend the Arizona Constitution to allow the state to exchange state trust land for other public land. The exchange must be in the best interest of the state land trust and the exchange must either conserve open space on the trust land offered by the state or assist in preserving military airports in Arizona. In order to permit the exchange, there must be public hearings to provide for public comment on the proposed exchange, the appraised value of the land the state receives in the exchange must at least equal the appraised value of the trust land the state exchanges, the state trust income must not be reduced, the financial impact of the exchange on each county, city or town and school district in which the lands are located must be analyzed and the physical, economic and natural resource impacts of the exchange on the surrounding community and local land uses and land use plans must be analyzed.",Proposition 100,Legislative Referendum,Environmental Protection,General,0.478,Amendment,0

At least 35% would be spent on regional plans based on the population of children up to five years of age in the region.<BR>  <BR>  2. At least 40% would be spent on regional plans based on the population of children up to five years of age in the region whose family income does not exceed one hundred per cent of the federal poverty guidelines.<BR>  <BR>  3. Up to 25% of the monies could be used to fund regional programs without consideration of regional population.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 would prescribe requirements for programs and grants that increase the quality of and access to early childhood development and health services for children up to five years of age and their families.<BR>  <BR>  Under Proposition 203, the Board would divide the state into an undetermined number of regions and would establish a regional partnership council for each region. The Board would appoint and set the compensation of the executive director. The executive director would hire regional directors and set the compensation of the regional directors. The councils would identify childhood development and health services needs and assets at a local level and spend monies that were budgeted annually by the Board.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. Proposition 203 increases the tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products and allocates the monies generated by the tax increase to various early childhood development and health care programs. The state tax on cigarettes would increase by 80 cents per pack and the tax on other types of tobacco products would be increased by a similar amount.<BR>  <BR>  The tax increase is estimated to generate $188 million in new revenue for early childhood development and health care programs during its first full year. Of this amount, at least 90% of the funds, an estimated $169.2 million, would be used for program costs and up to 10% of the funds, an estimated $18.8 million, would be used for administrative costs. Because some individuals may reduce their tobacco consumption when the price of tobacco increases, the state's existing tobacco tax collections may decrease.

181,Arizona,2006,Private Property Rights Protection Act,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL<BR>  <BR>  Eminent domain is the power of the government to take private property for public use. Proposition 207 sets forth the rights of a property owner when the state or a local government exercises the power of eminent domain. (These rights are in addition to the current statutory and constitutional rights.)<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 207 would limit the use of eminent domain to situations where eminent domain is authorized by the state and the property taken is put to a public use. The proposition defines ""public use"" to include:<BR>  <BR>  1. The use of land by the general public or by public agencies.<BR>  <BR>  2. The use of land for utilities.<BR>  <BR>  3. The acquisition of property to eliminate a direct threat to the public health or safety caused by the current condition of the property.<BR>  <BR>  4. The acquisition of abandoned property.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 207 excludes from the definition of public use the public benefits of economic development.<BR>  <BR>  The Arizona constitution prohibits a government from taking private property, unless the government provides just compensation to the property owner. Proposition 207 provides that as just compensation when a person's primary residence is taken by the government, the person must be provided a comparable replacement dwelling that is decent, safe and sanitary. The property owner may choose to receive money compensation instead of the replacement dwelling.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 207 also provides that a property owner is entitled to just compensation if the value of a person's property is reduced by the enactment of a land use law. A land use law is defined as a law that regulates the use or division of land, such as municipal zoning laws, or regulates accepted farming or forestry practices. The proposition sets out seven types of land use laws that are exempt from the compensation requirement.<BR>  <BR>  If a property owner were successful in an eminent domain law suit, Proposition 207 would require the government to pay the land owner's attorney fees and costs. If a property owner were successful in a law suit for reduction in the property's value, the court could award attorney fees and costs.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. Proposition 207 may increase the cost to state and local government to acquire private property for public use in some circumstances. The proposition also requires a property owner to be compensated, including reasonable attorney fees, if the value of a person's property is reduced by the enactment of a land use law.<BR>  <BR>  The proposition also prohibits the use of eminent domain for economic development.

183,Arizona,2006,Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of Arizona Relating to State Lands,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL<BR>  <BR>  In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state. The Enabling Act granted Arizona 10.9 million acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"", to be held in trust for the benefit of the named beneficiaries, primarily the public schools, as well as other public institutions (colleges, hospitals, prisons, etc.). Both the Enabling Act and the Arizona Constitution provide that the state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, to the ""highest and best bidder"" at advertised public auction and lands and products offered for sale must be appraised at and sold for not less than ""true value"". Proposition 106 would amend the Arizona Constitution to:<BR>  <BR>  1. Create a new seven member Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the State Senate, to plan and dispose of all state trust lands. A majority of the members must have substantial involvement with public schools, such as university governance or administration, teaching or education advocacy. The costs associated with the Board are to be paid with a portion of the proceeds (5% - 8%) derived from the sale or lease of trust lands. Currently, all of the proceeds go to benefit schools and other beneficiaries of the state trust.<BR>  <BR>  2. Create a Conservation Reserve, consisting of approximately 694,000 acres of state trust land, to be managed by a Board of Trustees. This trust land would no longer be available for sale to provide revenue for schools and other public institutions, although some revenue from leasing may be realized.<BR>  <BR>  3. Generally the land in the Conservation Reserve must be restricted against ""development"" and be managed in a manner consistent with ""conservation"", but not required to be accessible to the public unless and until conveyed out of the state land trust, as those terms are defined in this proposal, and subject to the following:<BR>  a. Any lease, right-of-way or other use in existence when this provision is enacted may continue.<BR>  b. ""Educational"" reserve land may be conveyed to the Arizona Board of Regents for research and education.  Buildings may be constructed on up to 50 acres of educational reserve land to support university programs.<BR>  c. ""Permanent"" reserve land may be conveyed by the Trustees to state or local governmental entities without payment, unless the land is leased for grazing.<BR>  d. ""Provisional"" reserve land may be conveyed by the Trustees to federal, state or local governmental entities or nonprofit conservation organizations upon payment of the true value of the land. Payment may be made in monetary or other forms of value that can be demonstrated by an appraisal. Provisional reserve lands not conveyed within a specified period of time may be removed from the Conservation Reserve and then treated in the same manner as other state trust land.<BR>  <BR>  4. Allow the Board of Trustees to adopt a method for determining the ""highest and best bid"" that does not require the highest return to the state trust.<BR>  <BR>  5. Provide that the Board of Trustees may convey title to state trust lands in exchange for an agreement to receive a share of anticipated gross revenues generated by the subsequent lease or sale of the land.<BR>  <BR>  6. Allow the Board of Trustees to grant public rights-of-way over state trust land, without conducting an advertised public auction, in exchange for any form of value that can be demonstrated by an appraisal.<BR>  <BR>  7. Require that land use planning for state trust lands be prepared in conjunction with the county, city or town where the land is located, according to generally applicable regulations that apply equally to similar private property in the jurisdiction. If the land use plan designates a part of the trust land for conservation, the Board of Trustees may convey that portion of the land to a state or local governmental entity without compensation, if the total compensation for all of the trust land subject to the plan is or will be at least equal to the ""true value"" of all of the subject land. The designated conservation land must be restricted against ""development"" and be managed in a manner consistent with ""conservation"" but not required to be accessible to the public unless and until conveyed out of the state land trust.<BR>  <BR>  8. Allow the Board of Trustees to set aside a portion of the proceeds generated from state trust lands for the administration, management, planning and disposition of the land.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 106 does not become fully effective unless the United States Congress amends the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act prior to 2009 to authorize the changes contained in this proposal.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. Proposition 106 contains provisions that may increase future revenues to state trust land beneficiaries and other provisions that may reduce revenues that otherwise would have been received by these beneficiaries. The proposition sets aside a percent of the proceeds from the disposition of state trust land for trust land administration. This provision may initially provide up to $6 million annually from proceeds that would otherwise have been invested for the beneficiaries. The additional administrative funding may permit the state to prepare trust land parcels for sale or lease more quickly, which may accelerate revenues to beneficiaries. The value of land generally appreciates over time. If state trust land is sold earlier under the proposition, the longer term fiscal impact may depend, at least in part, on the rate of investment returns of the accelerated revenue compared to the sale price at a later date.<BR>  <BR>  The proposition would permit certain parcels of trust land to be used for conservation without compensation. In this circumstance, the trust beneficiaries would not receive the proceeds from the sale of this land.

186,Arizona,2006,Relating to Cruel and Inhumane Confinement of Animals,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL<BR>  <BR>  Beginning January 1, 2013, Proposition 204 would amend the Arizona criminal code to make it a class 1 misdemeanor to tether or confine a pig during pregnancy or a calf raised for veal on a farm for all or the majority of a day in a manner that prevents the animal from lying down and fully extending its limbs or turning around freely. The law would not apply to:<BR>  <BR>  1. Pigs or calves during transportation.<BR>  <BR>  2. Pigs or calves in rodeo exhibitions, state or county fair exhibitions or other similar exhibitions.<BR>  <BR>  3. The lawful slaughter of pigs or calves.<BR>  <BR>  4.

Pigs or calves while undergoing an examination, test, treatment or operation for veterinary purposes.<BR>  <BR>  6. A pig during the seven day period before the pig's expected date of giving birth.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 204 would tentatively establish an enforcement and administration fund consisting of fines, penalties and other monies generated by the enforcement of this proposition and donations made to the fund. This fund would only be fully implemented if a court ultimately determined that creation of this fund is required by a separate state law dealing with the funding of programs created by a vote of the people.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. State and local governments may receive additional revenues in the form of fines and penalty assessments from violators of provisions of Proposition 204. The language of the proposition states that the measure does not impose mandatory expenditure of state revenues for any purpose. If, however, a court rules that the proposition results in mandatory expenditure of state revenue, a Humane Treatment of Farm Animals Fund is established and funded through enforcement related revenue and donations.

188,Arizona,2006,Smoke-Free Arizona Act,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL<BR>  <BR>  Currently, state statutes provide that smoking tobacco is prohibited in certain areas and most state buildings. A person who smokes where smoking is prohibited is guilty of a petty offense. Several cities and towns also have restrictions on smoking in public places.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 201 would prohibit smoking in all public places and places of employment, except as provided by the proposition.

Veterans and fraternal clubs when they are not open to the public.<BR>  <BR>  3. Hotel rooms designated as smoking rooms.<BR>  <BR>  4. Outdoor patios.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 201 would increase the state tax on cigarettes from $1.18 per pack to $1.20 per pack. Taxes on cigars and other tobacco products would not be increased by this proposition. Revenues collected from this tax would be deposited in a new Smoke-Free Arizona Fund to be administered by the Department of Health Services (DHS) to pay for enforcement and education costs.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 201 also would prescribe notice and other requirements for operating establishments to implement the smoking restrictions. In addition, an employer could not retaliate against an employee for exercising any rights provided by the proposition.<BR>  <BR>  A person who smokes where smoking is prohibited would be guilty of a petty offense.<BR>  <BR>  Under the proposition, DHS would implement and enforce these smoking restrictions. DHS would be required to design and implement a program to educate the public and business owners about the smoking restrictions. DHS would also be authorized to accept complaints about and investigate violations of the smoking restrictions. Proposition 201 would also require DHS to assess a civil penalty of at least $100 but less than $500 for each violation.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 201 would not prohibit or repeal more restrictive city, town or county laws.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. Proposition 201 increases the tax on cigarettes by 2 cents a pack and allocates the monies to the Department of Health Services for enforcement and education provisions.

The total amount of these collections will depend on the level of compliance, which is difficult to predict in advance.<BR>  <BR>  The tax increase is estimated to generate $4.7 million in new revenue for the state in its first full year. Because some individuals may reduce their tobacco consumption when the price of tobacco increases, the state's existing tobacco tax collections may decrease.

191,Arizona,2006,Your Right to Vote By Mail Act,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 205 would require every state, county and local election to be conducted by mail-in ballots, while allowing an absolute minimum number of countywide polling places to be used as well. Each registered voter would automatically be mailed a ballot not fewer than 15 days before the election, along with a pre-paid, stamped envelope for the return of the voted ballot. All ballots sent to voters would be by non-forwardable mail, with address correction requested. Voters would be instructed to return their ballots no later than the close of the election on election day.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 205 would require elections officials to maintain only the absolute minimum number of polling places, each of which would be open to any voter in the county, instead of being limited to voters in that election precinct. These countywide polling places could be located in election offices or other locations, other than school buildings. Existing provisions for voting by mail and on-site early voting remain unchanged.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 205 would repeal the existing requirement to mail sample ballots to voters.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT<BR>  <BR>  State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. Each household with a registered voter currently receives a sample ballot prior to state, county and local elections. These sample ballots may not be used for voting. Proposition 205 eliminates the requirement to provide sample ballots to households and instead requires mailing a regular ballot to each registered voter. As the sample ballot mailing is a state cost, elimination of that requirement may save the state approximately $1.7 million in election years. Since counties and local governments would have to mail regular ballots to each individual registered voter, their mailing costs are projected to be higher than the current cost of mailing the sample ballot to households. The counties and local governments, however, may reduce some of their other expenses. The counties and local governments are currently responsible for the cost of polling places. Since Proposition 205 would require an absolute minimum number of polling places, county and local government may experience savings depending on the revised number of polling places. The net fiscal impact on county and local governments is difficult to determine in advance and will depend, at least in part, on their higher costs to mail ballots to registered voters compared to the savings from a reduced number of polling places.<BR>  [Statutory]",Proposition 205,Initiative,Elections,General,0.289,,0

The seller would be required to provide the purchaser a choice of at least three qualified licensed contractors for each contract or subcontract for repair or replacement. The right of any seller to receive attorney and expert witness fees and costs even if the seller is the successful party is eliminated.<BR>  <BR>  8. A contract for the purchase of a dwelling could not require the purchaser to pay the attorney or expert fees of the seller under any circumstances.

The purchase of a dwelling would include a ten year warranty of the materials and workmanship. This warranty would transfer to any subsequent purchasers within the ten year warranty period.<BR>  <BR>  10. The contract for the sale of a newly constructed dwelling would need to include disclosures of a seller's financial relationships with any financial institution, including arrangements for mortgage financing, title insurance, or property and casualty insurance, ownership interests in the financial institution, and any commissions or payments the seller may receive as a result of the transaction with the buyer. This disclosure would also need to indicate whether a mortgage arranged by the seller will be held by the seller, the financial institution or is intended to be sold to other parties. A purchaser would be allowed to sue the seller for violating these disclosure requirements.<BR>  <BR>  11. A seller would not be allowed to require a deposit for a contract to sell a dwelling unless the contract allowed the purchaser to cancel the contract within 100 days and receive a refund of at least ninety-five per cent of the deposit.<BR>  <BR>  12.

The repayment plan would divide the customer's remaining balance into four substantially equal payments. A licensee would not be able to assess additional fees or interest on the outstanding balance or seek to collect any amount due except pursuant to the terms of the repayment plan so long as the customer fulfills his repayment plan obligation; otherwise, the customer could be taken to collections. A customer's obligation under the deferred presentment services agreement would be fulfilled if the repayment plan is completed. A customer would only be allowed to enter into a repayment plan once every 365 days.

Under Proposition 202, the definition of ""knowingly employ an unauthorized alien"" would be amended to require actual knowledge by an owner or officer of the employer.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would provide that a state, county or local official, in attempting to verify with the federal government if a person is authorized to work in the United States, shall rely solely upon the processes and procedures set forth in federal law. Additionally it allows the court to take judicial notice of the federal government's determination of legal work eligibility and provides the court may request the federal government to provide automated or testimonial verification pursuant to federal law.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 allows any person to file a written and signed complaint with the attorney general or county attorney that an employer in this state was either intentionally or knowingly employing an unauthorized alien in this state. If a person files a false or frivolous complaint, the person would be guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor. If the complaint is found to be valid, the appropriate federal and local officials would be notified by the attorney general or the county attorney. The county attorney would be authorized to bring an action against an employer only for violations that occur beginning January 1, 2009.<BR>  <BR>  For the first knowing violation in a three-year period, the court shall:<BR>  - Confirm that the employer has terminated or will terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state.<BR>  - Order the employer to be subject to a three-year probationary period and file quarterly reports with the county attorney of each new employee hired at the location where the unauthorized alien performed work.<BR>  - Order the employer to sign an affidavit stating that the employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally employ any unauthorized aliens in this state. If the affidavit is not signed, all licenses held by the employer that are necessary for the employer to operate the employer's business at the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work would be suspended until the affidavit is signed. If there are no licenses held by the employer specific to that business location, the court would be required to order the suspension of all licenses held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business in this state. The court would be authorized to order that the business licenses of the employer be suspended for no more than ten days if certain factors are present.<BR>  <BR>  For a first intentional violation in a five-year period, the court shall:<BR>  - Confirm that the employer has terminated or will terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state.<BR>  - Order the employer to be subject to a five-year probationary period and file quarterly reports with the county attorney of each new employee hired at the location where the unauthorized alien performed work.<BR>  - Order the employer to sign an affidavit stating that the employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state and that the employer will not knowingly or intentionally employ any unauthorized aliens in this state. If the affidavit is not signed, all licenses held by the employer that are necessary for the employer to operate the employer's business at the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work would be suspended until the affidavit is signed. If there are no licenses held by the employer specific to that business location, the court would be required to order the suspension of all licenses held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business in this state.<BR>  - Order the appropriate agencies to suspend all of the employer's business licenses as described above for a minimum of 10 days.<BR>  <BR>  For a second knowing or intentional violation during a probationary period, Proposition 202 would require the court to order the permanent revocation of all licenses held by the employer that are necessary for the employer to operate the employer's business at the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work. If there are no licenses held by the employer specific to that business location, the court would be required to order the permanent revocation of all licenses held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business in this state.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 creates a non-rebuttable presumption of innocence if an employer verifies work eligibility through the E-verify system or other method as provided under federal law. Additionally, it creates an affirmative defense of innocence if an employer establishes that it complied in good faith with the requirements of 8 United States Code section 1324a or 1324b.<BR>  <BR>  Under Proposition 202, an employer would not be required to take any action that would violate federal or state law.<BR>  <BR>  Beginning January 1, 2009, Proposition 202 would require every employer, after hiring an employee, to verify the employment eligibility of the employee through the federal employment electronic verification (E-Verify) program or through other documentation procedures authorized by federal law.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would authorize the attorney general to bring an action against an employer if the employer has more than four employees, pays hourly wages or salary in cash and fails to do any of the following:<BR>  - Withhold required taxes from the employee's compensation.<BR>  - Report the hiring of an employee to the state.<BR>  - Make the required contributions for unemployment compensation benefits.<BR>  - Provide employees coverage for workers compensation.<BR>  <BR>  If the employer is found guilty of any of these actions, the court would be required to enter a judgment against the employer for triple the amount of money that the employer failed to pay or $5,000 per employee for which a violation was committed, whichever is greater. All sums paid by the employer would be remitted to the Arizona department of education and the Arizona department of health services for distribution to school districts and emergency room providers to use to offset the costs of illegal immigration.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would expand the crime of identity theft to include a person who knowingly takes or uses personal identifying information of another person or entity without the consent of that other person or entity with the intent to obtain or continue employment. The crime of identity theft would also be expanded to include a person who knowingly accepts any personal identifying information of another person from an individual knowing that they are not the identified person and uses the information for work authorization under federal law. Identity theft is a class 4 felony.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would expand the crime of aggravated identity theft to include the theft of two or more identities or an identity theft that causes at least $1,000 in economic loss. Aggravated identity theft is a class 3 felony.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 202 would expand the crime of trafficking in the identity of another person or entity to include a person who sells personal identifying information of another person or entity with the intent of allowing another person to obtain or continue employment. Trafficking is a class 2 felony.",Proposition 202,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.408,Statutory,0
197,Arizona,2008,Prohibition of Any New Property Sale or Transfer Tax,"Proposition 100 would amend the Arizona Constitution to prohibit the state or any county, city, town or other political subdivision of the state from directly or indirectly imposing any new tax, fee or other assessment on the sale, purchase, transfer or other conveyance of any interest in real property (such as homes and other real estate). This proposed measure would not affect any tax, fee or other assessment in existence prior to this year.",Proposition 100,Initiative,Tax & Revenue,General,0.768,Amendment,1
198,Arizona,2008,Relating to Initiative Measures and Requiring that Any Mandatory Tax or Spending Increase Be Enacted by a Majority of Qualified Electors,"Proposition 105 would amend the Arizona Constitution to provide that an initiative measure that establishes, imposes or raises a tax, a fee or other revenue or mandates a spending obligation on a private person, a labor organization, other private legal entity or this state shall not become law unless the initiative measure is approved at the election by a majority of qualified electors registered to vote in the state.",Proposition 105,Initiative,Elections-Initiative Process,General,0.34,Amendment,0
199,Arizona,2008,State Legislators' Salaries,"Recommendation of the Commission on Salaries for Elective State Officers as to legislative salaries has been certified to the secretary of state and is hereby submitted to the qualified electors for their approval or rejection.<BR>   <BR>  Provides for an increase in the salaries of state legislators from $24,000 to $30,000 per year.",Proposition 300,Other,Labor & Employment,General,0.358,Other,0
200,Arizona,2010,Early Childhood Development and Health Programs,"Proposition 302 would:<BR>  <BR>  1. Redirect the ongoing tobacco tax revenues that are currently deposited in the Early Childhood Development and Health fund for deposit in the state general fund, to be separately accounted for and appropriated for health and human services for children.<BR>  <BR>  2. Transfer any remaining uncommitted Early Childhood Development and Health fund monies to the state general fund on December 1, 2010.<BR>  <BR>  3. Terminate the Arizona Early Childhood Development and Health Board on December 1, 2010.<BR>  <BR>  4. Repeal the Early Childhood Development and Health program statutes on June 1, 2011.<BR>  <BR>  The Early Childhood Development and Health Fund consists of revenues generated by an $.80 per pack tax on tobacco products and donations and state appropriations. The fund is administered by the Arizona Early Childhood Development and Health Board and is required to be used for the following purposes:<BR>  <BR>  1. Funding central and field offices, employing staff and establishing and appointing regional partnership councils, which make funding recommendations to the Board.<BR>  <BR>  2. Disbursing monies for programs and grants that increase the quality of and access to early childhood development and health services for children up to five years of age and their families.<BR>  <BR>  A ""yes"" vote shall have the effect of terminating the Arizona Early Childhood Development and Health Board and programs, which were established by voters in 2006 as part of the ""Arizona Early Childhood Development and Health Initiative."" It would require the transfer of money remaining in the early childhood development and education fund on December 1, 2010 to be deposited in the state general fund. Thereafter, it would require tobacco tax money collected pursuant to the initiative to be deposited in the state general fund and used for health and human services for children.<BR>  <BR>  A ""no"" vote shall have the effect of retaining the Arizona Early Childhood Development and Health Board and programs and keeping any money in the early childhood development and education fund.",Proposition 302,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.301,Statutory,0
201,Arizona,2010,Health Care Services,"Proposition 106 would amend the Arizona Constitution to:<BR>  <BR>  1.

Allow a person or employer to pay directly for lawful health care services without being penalized or fined.<BR>  <BR>  3.

202,Arizona,2010,Hunting and Fishing,"Proposition 109 would amend the Arizona Constitution to provide that:<BR>  <BR>  1. Wildlife is held in trust for the citizens of this state, whom have a right to lawfully hunt, fish and harvest the wildlife.<BR>  <BR>  2. The legislature has the exclusive authority to enact laws to regulate hunting, fishing and harvesting of wildlife. The legislature may grant rule making authority to a game and fish commission. No law or rule shall unreasonably restrict hunting, fishing or harvesting of wildlife or the use of traditional means and methods for those activities. Any law or rule shall have the purpose of wildlife conservation and management and preserving the future of hunting and fishing.<BR>  <BR>  3. Lawful public hunting and fishing are the preferred means of managing and controlling wildlife.<BR>  <BR>  By its terms, nothing in Proposition 109 shall be construed to modify any law relating to trespass or property rights.",Proposition 109,Legislative Referendum,Animal Rights/Hunting & Fishing,General,0.435,Amendment,0
203,Arizona,2010,Initiative Petitions,"11/18/2010:  The ""no"" side currently leads by 128 votes.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 112 would amend the Arizona Constitution to require that initiative petitions be filed at least six months before the date on which the measure will be voted on.

204,Arizona,2010,Lieutenant Governor,"Proposition 111 would amend the Arizona Constitution to rename the office of secretary of state as the office of lieutenant governor, beginning with the term of office that starts in 2015. The lieutenant governor elected in the November 2014 general election would assume all of the duties currently performed by the secretary of state, including being first in the line of succession to replace a governor unable to serve.<BR>  <BR>  The proposition provides that during the primary election, candidates for the office of lieutenant governor would run separately from candidates for the office of governor. The nominees selected at the primary election for the office of governor and lieutenant governor from the same political party would then run on a single ticket in the general election. At the general election, voters would cast a single vote for a candidate for governor, and that vote would constitute a vote for the ticket, including the candidate for lieutenant governor.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 111 also would make a technical change by consolidating two overlapping versions of Article V, section 1 of the Arizona Constitution and then repealing one of the overlapping versions.",Proposition 111,Legislative Referendum,State Government,General,0.408,Amendment,0
205,Arizona,2010,Medical Marijuana,"Proposition 203 would allow a ""qualifying patient"" who has a ""debilitating medical condition"" to obtain an ""allowable amount of marijuana"" from a ""nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary"" and to possess and use the marijuana to treat or alleviate the debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the condition. The Arizona Department of Health Services (DHS) would be required to adopt and enforce a regulatory system for the distribution of marijuana for medical use, including a system for approving, renewing and revoking the registration of qualifying patients, designated caregivers, nonprofit dispensaries and dispensary agents. The costs of the regulatory system would be paid from application and renewal fees collected, civil penalties imposed and private donations received pursuant to this proposition.<BR>  <BR>  A ""qualifying patient"" is defined as a person who has been diagnosed by a physician (a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, naturopathic medicine or homeopathy) as having one of the following debilitating medical conditions:<BR>  1. Cancer.<BR>  2. Glaucoma.<BR>  3. Positive status for human immunodeficiency virus.<BR>  4. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome.<BR>  5. Hepatitis C.<BR>  6. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<BR>  7. Crohn's disease.<BR>  8. Agitation of Alzheimer's disease.<BR>  9. A chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition that produces any of the following:<BR>  a. Cachexia or wasting syndrome.<BR>  b. Severe and chronic pain.<BR>  c. Severe nausea.<BR>  d. Seizures (including those characteristic of epilepsy).<BR>  e. Severe and persistent muscle spasms (including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis).<BR>  10. Any other medical condition added by DHS through a public petition process.<BR>  <BR>  In order to register with DHS, a qualifying patient must submit a signed written certification issued by the physician that states the physician's professional opinion that the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or symptom-relieving benefits from the medical use of marijuana to treat or alleviate a debilitating medical condition. The certification must specify the debilitating medical condition and must be made in the course of a physician-patient relationship after the physician has completed a full assessment of the patient's medical history. If the qualifying patient is under 18 years of age, the patient's custodial parent or legal guardian must submit written certifications from two physicians and the custodial parent or legal guardian must consent in writing to control the patient's medical use of the marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  A qualifying patient who is registered with DHS (or a registered designated caregiver on behalf of the qualifying patient) may obtain up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana in a 14-day period from a registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary. If the qualifying patient's home is located more than 25 miles from the nearest nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary, the patient or designated caregiver may cultivate up to 12 marijuana plants in an enclosed, locked facility.<BR>  <BR>  A registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary must be operated on a not-for-profit basis, but may receive payment for all expenses incurred in its operation. DHS may not issue more than one nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary registration certificate for every ten pharmacy permits issued by the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy under current law. The dispensary may cultivate marijuana only in an enclosed, locked facility and may acquire marijuana from a registered qualifying patient or designated caregiver if the patient or caregiver is not compensated for the marijuana. This proposition specifies various security, record-keeping and verification requirements relating to the operation of dispensaries.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 203 would generally provide that any person who acts in conformity with the requirements of the proposition is not subject to any governmentally imposed sanction relating to the medical use of marijuana. This proposition would prohibit certain discriminatory practices, including the following:<BR>  <BR>  1. A school or landlord may not refuse to enroll or lease to a person registered pursuant to this proposition unless failing to do so would cause the school or landlord to lose a monetary or licensing benefit under federal law.<BR>  <BR>  2. An employer may not discriminate against a person registered pursuant to this proposition in hiring, terminating or imposing employment conditions unless failing to do so would cause the employer to lose a monetary or licensing benefit under federal law. Further, an employer may not penalize a qualifying patient registered pursuant to this proposition for a positive drug test for marijuana, unless the patient used, possessed or was impaired by marijuana on the employment premises or during hours of employment.<BR>  <BR>  By its terms, Proposition 203 would not:<BR>  <BR>  1. Authorize a person to undertake any task under the influence of marijuana that constitutes negligence or professional malpractice.<BR>  <BR>  2. Authorize possessing or using medical marijuana on a school bus, on the grounds of a preschool, primary school or high school or in a correctional facility.<BR>  <BR>  3. Authorize smoking marijuana on public transportation or in a public place.<BR>  <BR>  4. Authorize operating, navigating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, aircraft or motorboat while under the influence of marijuana. A registered qualifying patient would not be considered to be under the influence of marijuana solely because of the presence of marijuana in the person's system that appears in a concentration insufficient to cause impairment.<BR>  <BR>  5. Require a government medical assistance program or private health insurer to reimburse a person for costs associated with the medical use of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  6. Require an owner of private property to allow the use of marijuana on that property.<BR>  <BR>  7. Require an employer to allow the ingestion of marijuana in the workplace.<BR>  <BR>  8. Prevent a nursing care or other residential or inpatient healthcare facility from adopting reasonable restrictions on the provision, storage and use of marijuana by residents or patients.",Proposition 203,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.501,Statutory,1
206,Arizona,2010,Preferential Treatment or Discrimination Prohibition,"Proposition 107 would amend the Arizona Constitution to ban affirmative action programs that give preferential treatment to or discriminate against any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting. This proposition does not prohibit bona fide qualifications based on sex that are reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education or public contracting. This proposition would not prohibit action necessary to prevent a loss of federal funding to the state and would not invalidate any existing court orders. The remedies for violations of this proposition would be the same as for violations of current antidiscrimination laws. This proposition applies to the state, counties, cities, towns, special districts and other political subdivisions of the state, including school districts, public universities and community college districts.<BR>  <BR>  This proposition would apply only to actions that are taken after the effective date of this proposition.",Proposition 107,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.595,Amendment,1
207,Arizona,2010,Right to Vote a Secret Ballot Regarding Employee Representation,"Proposition 113 would amend the Arizona Constitution to guarantee the fundamental right to vote by secret ballot when a local, state or federal law permits or requires an election, designation or authorization for employee representation.",Proposition 113,Legislative Referendum,Labor & Employment,General,0.605,Amendment,1
208,Arizona,2010,State Trust Lands,"In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state. The Enabling Act granted Arizona approximately 10.9 million acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"". The state land trust is intended to produce revenue for various public institutions (schools, colleges, prisons, etc.). The state can lease or sell trust land, and the natural products (timber, minerals, etc.) of the land, only to the ""highest and best bidder"" at public auction.<BR>  <BR>  In 1936, Congress amended the Enabling Act to give Arizona more flexibility in managing and disposing of trust land by allowing the state to exchange trust land for other public or private lands. Arizona did not amend its state Constitution to incorporate that authority for land exchanges. The Arizona Supreme Court has determined that without amending the Arizona Constitution the state cannot conduct land exchanges.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 110 would amend the Arizona Constitution to allow the state to dispose of (for example, sell or lease) state trust land or interests in trust land or to place restrictions on interests or rights in trust lands, without advertisement or auction, in order to avoid incompatible use of the trust land that would interfere with military installations, facilities, ranges, airspace or operations or to enable military combat readiness and allow full spectrum test and training operations.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 110 would also amend the Arizona Constitution to allow the state to exchange state trust land for other public land. The exchange must be in the best interest of the state land trust. The purpose of the exchange must be to either assist in preserving and protecting military facilities in this state from encroaching development or for the proper management, protection or public use of state lands. There must be two independent appraisals that show that the true value of the land the state receives in the exchange is equal to or greater than the true value of the trust land the state conveys. There must also be two independent analyses that detail the income to the state land trust before and the projected income to the trust after the exchange, the financial impact of the exchange on each county, city, town and school district in which the lands are located, the physical, economic and natural resource impacts of the exchange on the local community and the impacts on local land uses and land use plans. A detailed public notice of a proposed exchange must be given, public hearings must be held and an opportunity for public comment must be given. A proposed exchange is not effective unless it is approved by the voters at a statewide November general election.",Proposition 110,Legislative Referendum,Natural Resources,General,0.49700000000000005,Amendment,0
209,Arizona,2010,Temporary Transaction Privilege and Use Taxes,"Considered on May 18, 2010.<BR>  <BR>  SCR 1001 constitutionally levies an additional, temporary 1% transaction privilege tax (TPT) and use tax for three years, subject to voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  <B>History</B><BR>  Arizona's TPT is imposed on the privilege of transacting business in this state.  The tax rates on various taxable activities range from 2.5% to 5%, depending on the type of business, with most rates at 5%.  In addition, most taxable activities also include a state rate of 0.6% dedicated for education purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The TPT base is divided into two parts, the distribution base and the non-shared portion.  The distribution base is split three ways: 25% goes to the incorporated municipalities, 40.51% goes to the counties, and the remaining 34.49% is deposited in the state General Fund (GF).  There are no restrictions on how local governments use their shared revenues from this source.  The non-shared portion is deposited directly in the GF.<BR>  <BR>  The use tax is imposed on the purchase prices of tangible personal property that is purchased out-of-state and brought into Arizona for use.  The tax is imposed when a TPT equal to or greater than the Arizona rate was not paid.  The revenues from the use tax are all deposited in the GF.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Fiscal Impact</B><BR>  <BR>  According to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC), if SCR 1001 is approved by the voters, there will be no impact to the GF in FY 2009-10.  JLBC estimates an increase in TPT and use tax revenues of $943 million in FY 2010-11, $968 million in FY 2011-12, and $1 billion in FY 2012-13.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Provisions</B><BR>  · Proposes a temporary amendment to the Arizona Constitution to provide a 1% increase of the state TPT and use tax imposed on the current taxable base subject to a rate of 5% or more.<BR>  · If approved, directs the tax to be levied and collected beginning on June 1, 2010 and continue for 36 consecutive months.<BR>  · Specifies the tax is separate from, and in addition to, the current state TPT and use tax rates and will not be distributed to counties, municipalities, or other government entities.<BR>  · Directs the tax revenues to be separately accounted for in the state General Fund as follows:<BR>  -- Two-thirds appropriated to public primary and secondary education.<BR>  -- One-third appropriated to health and human services and public safety.<BR>  · Stipulates the tax is subject to the same exemptions, deductions, and exclusions currently provided by law for TPT and use tax.<BR>  · Provides for the tax to be administered and collected in the same manner currently provided by law for TPT and use tax.<BR>  · Maintains any unpaid tax liability incurred while the tax was in effect is still an obligation of the taxpayer that is due and payable after the expiration of the tax.<BR>  · Repeals the temporary tax on May 31, 2013.<BR>  · Requires the Secretary of State to submit the temporary constitutional tax increase to the voters at a special election called on May 18, 2010.",Proposition 100,Legislative Referendum,Education: PreK-12,Special,0.643,Amendment,1
210,Arizona,2010,The Land Conservation Fund,"The Land Conservation Fund consists of monies appropriated from the state general fund and monies received as donations. $20,000,000 was appropriated annually for 11 years from the state general fund to the Land Conservation Fund. The final appropriation is scheduled in fiscal year 2010-2011. Monies in the fund must be used to award grants to:<BR>  <BR>  1. Acquire and conserve state trust land or development rights in state trust land.<BR>  <BR>  2. Implement conservation based management or reduce production on state lands leased for agricultural purposes.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 301 would transfer the remaining balance in the Land Conservation Fund to the state general fund.",Proposition 301,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.26,Amendment,0

Proposition 114 would amend these sections of the Arizona Constitution to provide an exception that a crime victim is not subject to a claim for damages by a person who is harmed while attempting to engage in conduct classified as a felony offense, while engaging in conduct classified as a felony offense or while fleeing from such conduct.<BR>  <BR>  Article II, section 2.1 of the Arizona Constitution provides that a ""victim"" is a person against whom a criminal offense has been committed, or if that person is killed or incapacitated, that person's spouse, parent, child or other lawful representative.",Proposition 114,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.802,Amendment,1
212,Arizona,2012,Establishment Of Permanent Funds,"In 1910, the United States Congress passed the Arizona-New Mexico Enabling Act, allowing Arizona to become a state and granting Arizona approximately 10.9 million acres of land, referred to as ""state trust land"". The state land trust produces revenue for various public institutions in this state (schools, colleges, prisons, etc.). Proposition 118 would amend the Arizona Constitution to provide that for fiscal years 2012-2013 through 2020-2021, the annual distribution from the state trust land permanent funds to the various public institutions would be 2.5% of the average market values of the fund for the immediately preceding five calendar years. After fiscal year 2020-2021, the distribution formula would return to the current formula set out in the Arizona Constitution: average total rate of return for the previous five fiscal years, less percentage change in inflation, multiplied by the average market value over the previous five years.",Proposition 118,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.507,Amendment,1
213,Arizona,2012,Open Elections/Open Government Act,"Beginning with the 2014 elections, Proposition 121 would amend the Arizona Constitution by eliminating the longstanding primary election that allows each recognized political party in Arizona to select its own nominee for the general election. In its place would be a primary election system in which registered voters may vote for candidates regardless of political affiliation. A funding source has not been identified that will pay the cost of the open top two primary election that will replace the current system. Additionally, the number of candidates who appear on the general election ballot would be limited to only the two who receive the most votes and any qualified write-in candidates, except that, for any office to which more than one candidate shall be elected, the number of candidates who will compete in the general election shall be the number of candidates to be elected times two. Currently, all candidates who receive the most votes in their party primary appear on the general election ballot. This often results in more than two candidates appearing on the general election ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 121 would not apply to the election of United States President, nor to any office for which political party affiliation may not appear on the ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Under Proposition 121, the signature requirement for candidates wishing to run in the open primary election for an office would be based on the total votes cast for all candidates for that office at the previous general election and would be the same for all candidates regardless of party affiliation or lack of affiliation. Each candidate who declared a party preference on their voter registration form would have that preference listed, up to twenty characters, on the nominating petition and on the primary and general election ballots. If no party preference is declared on a candidate's registration form, no preference would be listed on the petition and ballots. All government-issued voter education materials and ballots would contain a notice that any political party registration listed for a candidate is not an indication that the candidate has been nominated or endorsed by that political party.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 121 provides that individuals may organize or join political parties and that political parties may elect party officers, support or oppose candidates and otherwise participate in all elections, if the party activity is not paid for or subsidized using public funds.

215,Arizona,2012,Quality Education and Jobs Act,"The temporary state sales tax rate of 6.6 percent enacted on May 28, 2010 expires on May 31, 2013, resulting in a decrease of the sales tax rate to 5.6 percent.

In addition, Proposition 204 would provide that the specified funding levels for the state's kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade and state university systems cannot be reduced below the levels for fiscal year 2011-2012 or 2012-2013, whichever is greater, that limits on school district bonds and overrides cannot be below those in effect for 2012, that vehicle license tax and related highway user revenues cannot be diverted for any other purpose and that the sales tax base applicable to the proposed one cent sales tax increase cannot be adjusted in a way that causes the amount of sales tax collected to be less than the amount collected in the prior year, plus six per cent, unless there is a corresponding change in the tax base that results in no reduction in the amount of sales tax collected. The Legislature would not have the ability to adjust the new tax increase disbursements under any circumstances.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 204 would annually distribute the first one billion dollars of additional sales tax as follows, or, if one billion dollars is not collected, the money would be proportionally distributed as follows:<BR>  <BR>  1.

Up to one hundred twenty-five million dollars to the state general fund to fund the required inflationary adjustment for the kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade school system.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 204 would annually distribute the amount of additional sales tax over one billion dollars as follows:<BR>  <BR>  1.

Nearly two-thirds of the cities with a sales tax on food (65%) impose a 1% sales tax while the majority of the remaining cities impose a sales tax greater than 1%.<BR>   <BR>  How would government services be affected?<BR>  <BR>  If the amendment passes no new, additional, or increased taxes may be imposed on food and medicine. However, taxes on food and medicine established before the effective date of this amendment will continue to be collected until July 3, 2003. Beginning July 4, 2003 taxes will not be collected on food and medicine, except where sales tax revenue was used to secure bonds or other contractual obligations. Sales tax revenue on food and medicine will continue to be collected until these bonds and obligations are paid.<BR>  <BR>  It is not clear how much state and local revenue would be lost if the amendment passes because it is unknown how ""food"" and ""medicine"" will be defined when the regulations are written. Likely, the courts will be called upon to define ""food"" and ""medicine"" in the context of the ballot title.<BR>  <BR>  With these uncertainties, the Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) has estimated the revenue that would be lost under different possible interpretations.  Proponents argue that these are estimates of the money that will remain in the pockets of citizens, and businesses that purchase food, if the amendment passes.<BR>  <BR>  One Scenario<BR>  <BR>  If food is defined to include all three components above, the Department of Finance and Administration estimates lost revenue as follows:<BR>  <BR>  State Revenue Loss:  $279.7 million<BR>  - General Fund:  $245.6 million<BR>  - 1/8 cent Conservation tax:  $ 6.8 million<BR>  - 1/2 cent Property Tax Relief:  $ 27.3 million<BR>  <BR>  Local Revenue Loss:  $114.1 million<BR>  <BR>  Medicaid Fund Loss:  $ 42.0 million<BR>  <BR>  Estimated Tax Revenue Lost:  $435.8 million<BR>  <BR>  Estimated Federal Match Loss:  $126.0 million<BR>  <BR>  Estimated Total Revenue Loss:  $561.8 million<BR>  <BR>  Other Scenarios<BR>  <BR>  If restaurant sales are not defined as food, then the sales tax on restaurant sales would still be collected and the revenue lost by state and local governments would be less than the above calculations. Various scenarios could exist depending on the definition of food.<BR>  <BR>  How would households be affected?<BR>  <BR>  If the amendment passes and no new taxes are passed, households will pay less sales tax. How much less sales tax is the question. If ""food"" is interpreted to mean food purchased to be eaten at home, then using information from the Consumer Expenditure Survey we can estimate the amount of sales tax savings from food purchases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that a household making between $20,000 and $29,999 a year will spend $2,921 on food purchases eaten at home. Households in this income category would not have to pay the $150 in state sales tax and any local sales taxes collected on this food if the amendment passes. If local county and city sales taxes combined are 2%, then the household would save an additional $58 for a total sales tax savings of $208.<BR>  [CA]",Proposed Amendment 3,Initiative,Health,General,0.39,,0
250,Arkansas,2002,An Amendment to Repeal the Provision in Arkansas Constitution Amendment 50 for the Numbering and Recording of Election ballots Next to Name of the Voter,"House Joint Resolution 1004 proposes to amend the Arkansas Constitution to assure the secrecy of every vote. It does so by repealing Section 3 of Amendment 50 which requires that every ballot be traceable back to every voter through an assigned ballot number for the purpose of determining the purity of the election.<BR>  <BR>  The Intent:<BR>  <BR>  The Arkansas Supreme Court cited Section 3 of Amendment 50 in a decision that placed greater importance on the ability to trace ballots in assuring the purity of an election than on the secrecy of the ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Section 3, Amendment 50 allows for a possible court order to trace ballots to assure purity of an election.<BR>  <BR>  The people of Arkansas believe that the secrecy of their ballot is of the utmost importance.<BR>  <BR>  By repealing Section 3 of Amendment 50, voters will guarantee themselves the right to a secret ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Why is the issue on the ballot of a General Election?<BR>  Proposed Constitutional Amendment No. 1 is a change in the Arkansas Constitution and is in response to the conflict which emerges in Section 3 of Amendment 50 regarding the right to secrecy of ballot versus the need to guarantee the purity of the election. All questions of change to the State*s Constitution require a vote of the people.<BR>  <BR>  Does this change mean a higher cost or increased taxes for me as an Arkansas citizen?<BR>  It will not affect taxes nor should it increase or decrease costs. It addresses the issue of secrecy of the vote and so would disallow the recording of ballot numbers beside the names of voters.<BR>  <BR>  What happens if this proposed amendment does not pass?<BR>  Ballots will continue to be numbered and the number will be recorded beside the name of each voter. This will allow the courts to request that votes be traced back to voters as a means for assuring purity of each election.",Proposed Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.57,,1
251,Arkansas,2002,Proposing a Constitutional to Revise the Executive Article of the Arkansas Constitution,"What are the significant changes in the proposed amendment from the current article in the Arkansas Constitution?<BR>  - Allows the Governor to retain his/her powers when he/she is out of the state. (Currently the Lieutenant Governor assumes those powers when the Governor is out of the state.)<BR>  - Provides the elected officers of the executive department will be elected at a general election except as otherwise provided in the law or Constitution.<BR>  - Provides that the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Auditor, Attorney General and Commissioner of State Lands shall be U.S. citizens, registered voters and residents of Arkansas for 7 years.

Existing law provides that after the legislature finally adjourns, the Governor has twenty days to sign or veto a bill or a line item in an appropriation bill.)<BR>  <BR>  The following provisions are already in the current Constitution or state law in one place or the other. This new language is meant to more directly state, consolidate and clarify these laws.<BR>  - Allows the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Attorney General, Commissioner of State Lands and State Auditor to receive retirement benefits, insurance and other benefits available to state employees.<BR>   - Allows the Governor to fill any state elective office (except Lieutenant Governor, member of the General Assembly or the U.S. House of Representatives) when it becomes vacant unless the Constitution or laws provide procedures to fill the vacancy.<BR>  - Provides that for any reason the Governor's office becomes vacant that the order of succession will be Lieutenant Governor, President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The General Assembly will establish successors in cases not covered in this section.<BR>  <BR>  When does the legislation take effect if passed?<BR>  - The amendment, if passed, would become effective January 1, 2003.<BR>  <BR>  What significant provisions in the proposed amendment will remain the same as the current constitution?<BR>  - The executive officers of the state referred to in this amendment will serve four year terms and will be limited to two terms.<BR>  - The salaries of the executive officers can be changed at a general election but may also be increased by the General Assembly by an amount not to exceed the average percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers published by the United States Department of Labor.<BR>  - The current executive officer salaries allowed by this amendment are as follows:<BR>  Governor - $73,603<BR>  Lieutenant Governor - $35,574<BR>  Secretary of State - $46,002<BR>  Treasurer of State - $46,002<BR>  Attorney General - $61,335<BR>  Commissioner of State Lands - $46,002<BR>  Auditor of State - $46,002<BR>  - No executive officer may be reimbursed for expenses except for those reasonably connected to official duties and only if the reimbursement is for documented expenses actually incurred. <BR>  - The Governor will report periodically to the General Assembly, will be the Commander in Chief of the State Militia, will keep the State Seal, will sign all grants and commissions, will have the power to pardon and reprieve, can sign or veto bills by the General Assembly, will have the power to veto line items in a bill appropriating money and can call the General Assembly into special session.<BR>  - Contested elections of these executive officers will be decided by the General Assembly.<BR>  - The Lieutenant Governor will preside over the Senate and vote only in case of a tie.<BR>  - If the Lieutenant Governor leaves office for any reason, the Governor will call for a special election to fill the vacancy.<BR>  - The executive officers may not hold any other office, civil or military, in Arkansas or the U.S.<BR>  <BR>  Does the amendment raise taxes?<BR>  The amendment does not raise taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Is there any organized opposition to this amendment?<BR>  As of this writing there appears to be no strong organized opposition to this amendment.",Proposed Amendment 2,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.45,,0
252,Arkansas,2002,The Arkansas Animal Cruelty Act,"What does this proposed act do?<BR>  <BR>  - The act amends current law to create an act of *aggravated animal cruelty,* a Class D Felony (punishable by up to 6 years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine for a first offense and up to 40 years in prison depending on the number of prior or subsequent felony convictions). The act defines *aggravated animal cruelty* as when a person knowingly tortures, mutilates, maims, burns, poisons, or maliciously kills, starves, or disfigures animals. It leaves unaltered the current Class A Misdemeanor penalties (punishable by up to $1,000 in fines and up to one year in prison) with the exception that it links subsequent Class A Misdemeanor animal cruelty convictions to classify the second offense as a Class D Felony. Felony convictions also carry with them the loss of certain rights commonly taken for granted by citizens. Included are the rights to vote, hold public elected office and own or possess a firearm of any kind. Other fines and costs are linked to court authorized care and keeping of abused animals and psychological care and counseling for those convicted as required by the court.<BR>  - It changes the current statute prohibiting *dog* fighting to prohibit *animal* fighting and to further prohibit manufacture or sale of animal fighting equipment, supporting animal fighting, being present at an animal fight presented as a public spectacle or owning/possessing devices with the intent of using such device for animal fighting or to enhance an animal*s fighting ability.    • The act enables forfeiture of animals that are deemed abused or mistreated in the eyes of the court and specifies the disposition of the animals seized by the court. The statute also sets limits for notice and claims of interest in an animal seized under the Animal Cruelty Act authority (at least 41 days from the date of first publishing the court order). This provision in the act allows the court to take possession of an animal even prior to trial if a preponderance of evidence is established to indicate an act of cruelty or aggravated animal cruelty. This court action can be taken in advance of a person*s conviction or acquittal on either charge of Misdemeanor or Felony Animal Cruelty. This *Statutory Lien* provision in the act is a change from existing law.<BR>  - The act enables forfeiture of animals that are deemed abused or mistreated in the eyes of the court and specifies the disposition of the animals seized by the court.

The state would use these bond funds to provide grants to local governments to: (1) construct new libraries, (2) expand or renovate existing libraries, and (3) provide related furnishings and equipment. This grant program would be similar to the 1988 program. For example, local agencies would again have to pay 35 percent of the project cost.<BR>  <BR>  Bonds. General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning the state is required to pay the principal and interest costs on these bonds. State General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs. These revenues come primarily from state personal and corporate income taxes and the sales tax.<BR>  <BR>  Grant Program. Under the program, local agencies would apply to the state for grants of between $50,000 and $20 million. As noted above, the grants could be used either to add new library space or renovate existing space. These funds could not be used for (1) books and other library materials, (2) certain administrative costs of the project, (3) interest costs or other charges for financing the project, or (4) ongoing operating costs of the new or renovated facility.<BR>  <BR>  The proposition provides for a six-member state board to adopt policies for the program and decide which local agencies would receive grants. In reviewing local applications, the board must consider factors such as (1) the relative needs of urban and rural areas, (2) library services available to the local residents, and (3) the financial ability of local agencies to operate library facilities.<BR>  <BR>  The proposition also provides for certain priorities for the grant monies. For instance, in considering applications for a new library, the state must give first priority to so called ""joint use"" libraries. These are libraries that serve both the community and a particular school district (or districts). In addition, for renovation projects, the state must give first priority to projects in areas where public schools have inadequate facilities to support access to computers and other educational technology.<BR>  <BR>  Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:<BR>  <BR>  State cost of about $600 million over 25 years to pay off both the principal ($350 million) and interest ($250 million) costs on the bonds.

Redefines such fees as taxes.  Excludes certain real property related fees, assessments and development fees.  Excludes damages, penalties, or expenses recoverable from a specific event.

296,California,2000,Gambling on Tribal Lands.  Legislative Constitutional Amendment.,"This proposition amends the State Constitution to permit Indian tribes to conduct and operate slot machines, lottery games, and banked and percentage card games on Indian land. These gambling activities could only occur if (1) the Governor and an Indian tribe reach agreement on a compact, (2) the Legislature approves the compact, and (3) the federal government approves the compact. (Although this proposition authorizes lottery games, Indian tribes can currently operate lottery games--subject to a gambling compact. This is because the State Constitution permits the State Lottery, and Indian tribes can operate any games already permitted in the state.)<BR>  <BR>  State and Local Revenue Impact<BR>  <BR>  This measure would likely result in an increase in economic activity in California. The magnitude of the increase would depend primarily on (1) the extent to which tribal gambling operations expand and (2) the degree to which new gambling activity in California is from spending diverted from Nevada and other out-of-state sources (as compared to spending diverted from other California activities).<BR>  <BR>  While the measure would likely result in additional economic activity in California, its impact on state and local revenues is less clear. This is because, as sovereign governments, tribal businesses and members are exempt from certain forms of taxation. For example, profits earned by gambling activities on tribal lands would not be subject to state corporate taxes. In addition, gambling on tribal lands is not subject to wagering taxes that are currently levied on other forms of gambling in California (horse race wagers, card rooms, and the Lottery). Finally, wages paid to tribal members employed by the gambling operation and living on Indian land would not be subject to personal income taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Even with these exemptions, tribal operations still generate tax revenues. For example, wages paid to nontribal employees of the operations are subject to income taxation. In addition, certain nongambling transactions related to the operations are subject to state and local sales and use taxes. However, on average, each dollar spent in tribal operations generates less tax revenue than an equivalent dollar spent in other areas of the California economy.<BR>  <BR>  Given these factors, the net impact of this measure on state and local government revenues is uncertain. For example, revenues could increase significantly if the measure were to result in a large expansion in gambling operations and a large portion of the new gambling was spending that would have otherwise occurred outside of California (such as in Nevada). On the other hand, if the expansion of gambling were relatively limited or if most of the new gambling represented spending diverted from other areas in the state's economy that are subject to taxation, the fiscal impact would not be significant.<BR>  [CA]",Proposition 1A,Legislative Referendum,Gambling & Lotteries,Primary,0.645,,1

The money raised from the bond sales would be used for the construction, renovation, and infrastructure costs of these laboratories. General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is required to pay the principal and interest costs on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs. These revenues come primarily from the state personal and corporate income taxes and sales tax. A new seven-member Forensic Laboratories Authority created by the measure, would consider applications and award the bond monies to local governments for the construction of new laboratories and the renovation of existing laboratories. The measure specifies that members of the authority include the Attorney General, the director of the state's laboratories, and five members appointed by the Governor. In order to receive bond monies, a local government must provide 10 percent of total project costs (this provision could be modified or waived by the Legislature).

320,California,2002,Education Facilities:  Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002 and 2004,"Background<BR>  <BR>  Public education in California consists of two distinct systems. One system includes local school districts that provide elementary and secondary (kindergarten through 12th grade, or K-12) education to about 6.1 million pupils. The other system (commonly referred to as ""higher education"") includes local community colleges, the California State University (CSU), and the University of California (UC). The three segments of higher education provide education programs beyond the 12th grade to about 2.3 million students.<BR>  <BR>  K-12 Schools<BR>  School Facilities Funding. The K-12 schools receive funding for construction and renovation of facilities from two main sources--the state and local general obligation bonds.<BR>  - State Funding.<BR>  The state, through the School Facility Program (SFP), provides money for school districts to buy land and to construct, renovate, and modernize K-12 school buildings. Districts receive funding for construction and renovation based on the number of pupils who meet the eligibility criteria of the program. The cost of school construction projects is shared between the state and local school districts.  The state pays 50 percent of the cost of new construction projects and 60 percent of the cost for approved modernization projects. (Local matches are not necessary in so-called ""hardship"" cases.) The state has funded the SFP by issuing general obligation bonds. Over the past decade, voters have approved a total of $11.5 billion in state bonds for K–12 school construction. About $550 million of these funds remain available for expenditure.<BR>  - Local General Obligation Bonds.<BR>  School districts are authorized to sell general obligation bonds to finance school construction projects with the approval of 55 percent of the voters in the district.  These bonds are paid off by taxes on real property located within the district. Over the last ten years, school districts have received voter approval to issue more than $23 billion of general obligation bonds.<BR>  <BR>  Although school facilities have been funded primarily from state and local general obligation bonds, school districts also receive significant funds from:<BR>  - Developer Fees. State law authorizes local governments to impose developer fees on new construction. These fees are levied on new residential, commercial, and industrial developments.  Statewide, school districts report having received an average of over $300 million a year in developer fees over the last ten years.<BR>  - Special Local Bonds (Known as ""Mello-Roos"" Bonds). School districts may form special districts in order to sell bonds for school construction projects.  (These special districts generally do not encompass the entire school district.) The bonds, which require two-thirds voter approval, are paid off by charges assessed to property owners in the special district.  Statewide, school districts have received on average about $150 million a year in special local bond proceeds over the past decade.<BR>  <BR>  K-12 School Building Needs.<BR>  Under the SFP, K-12 school districts must demonstrate the need for new or modernized facilities. Through May 2002, the districts have identified a need to construct new schools to house 1.2 million pupils and modernize schools for an additional 1.2 million pupils. We estimate the state cost to address all of these needs to be roughly $20 billion.<BR>  <BR>  Higher Education<BR>  California's system of public higher education includes 140 campuses in the three segments listed below, serving about 2.3 million students:<BR>  - The California Community Colleges provide instruction to 1.7 million students at 108 campuses operated by 72 locally governed districts throughout the state. The community colleges grant associate degrees and also offer a variety of vocational skill courses.<BR>  - The CSU system has 23 campuses, with an enrollment of about 395,000 students. The system grants bachelor and master degrees, and a small number of joint doctoral degrees with UC.<BR>  - The UC has eight general campuses and one health sciences campus with a total enrollment of about 184,000 students. This system offers bachelor, master, and doctoral degrees, and is the primary state-supported agency for research.<BR>  <BR>  Over the past decade, the voters have approved nearly $4.4 billion in general obligation bonds for capital improvements at public higher education campuses. The state also has provided almost $1.5 billion in lease revenue bonds for this same purpose.<BR>  <BR>  In addition to these state bonds, the higher education segments have other sources of funding for capital projects.<BR>  - Local General Obligation Bonds. Community college districts are authorized to sell general obligation bonds to finance school construction projects with the approval of 55 percent of the voters in the district. These bonds are paid off by taxes on real property located within the district. Over the last decade, community college districts have received local voter approval to issue about $5 billion of bonds for construction and renovation of facilities.<BR>  - Gifts and Grants. The CSU and UC in recent years together have received on average over $100 million annually in gifts and grants for construction of facilities.<BR>  - UC Research Revenue. The UC finances the construction of new research facilities by selling bonds and pledging future research revenue for their repayment. Currently, UC uses about $125 million a year of research revenue to pay off these bonds.<BR>  <BR>  Higher Education Building Plans.<BR>  Each year the institutions of higher education prepare capital outlay plans in which they identify project priorities over the next few years. Higher education capital outlay projects in the most recent plans total $4.4 billion for the period 2003-04 through 2006-07.<BR>  <BR>  Proposal<BR>  <BR>  This measure allows the state to issue $13.05 billion of general obligation bonds for construction and renovation of K-12 school facilities ($11.4 billion) and higher education facilities ($1.65 billion). General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is obligated to pay the principal and interest costs on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs. These revenues come primarily from state income and sales taxes.<BR>  <BR>  K-12 School Facilities<BR>  The measure would permit changes in the allocation with  the approval of the Legislature and Governor.<BR>  <BR>  New Construction. A total of $6.35 billion would be available to buy land and construct new school buildings. Of this amount, $2.9 billion would be set aside for ""backlog"" projects--that is, projects for which districts had submitted applications on or before February 1, 2002, but that have not yet been funded. The remaining funds--$3.45 billion--would be available for new construction projects submitted after February 1, 2002. Districts would be required to pay for 50 percent of costs with local resources. The measure also provides that up to $100 million of the $3.45 billion in new construction funds is available for charter school facilities. (Charter schools are public schools that operate independently of many of the requirements of regular public schools.)<BR>  <BR>  Modernization. The proposition makes $3.3 billion available for the reconstruction or modernization of existing school facilities. Of this amount, $1.9 billion would be available for backlog projects and $1.4 billion for new proposals. Districts would be required to pay 40 percent of project costs from local resources.<BR>  <BR>  Critically Overcrowded Schools. This proposition directs a total of $1.7 billion to districts with schools which are considered critically overcrowded. These funds would go to schools that have a large number of pupils relative to the size of the school site.<BR>  <BR>  Joint-Use Projects. The measure makes a total of $50 million available to fund joint-use projects. (An example of a joint-use project is a facility constructed for use by both a K-12 school district and a local library district.)<BR>  <BR>  Higher Education Facilities<BR>  The measure includes $1.65 billion to construct new buildings and related infrastructure, alter existing buildings, and purchase equipment for use in these buildings for California's public higher education systems. The Governor and the Legislature would select the specific projects to be funded by the bond monies.<BR>  <BR>  Related Bond Funding. The legislation which placed this proposition on the ballot provides $651.3 million in lease revenue bonds to fund specific projects.  Lease revenue bonds are similar to state general obligation bonds except they do not require voter approval and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the state. This would fund $279 million for UC (7 projects), $191.3 million for CSU (4 projects), $170.5 million for the community colleges (11  projects), and $10.5 million for the California State Library (1 project).<BR>  <BR>  Future Education Bond Act<BR>  The legislation which placed this proposition on the ballot authorizes a $12.3 billion bond measure to be placed on the 2004 primary election ballot. (If the voters do not approve this measure, the same bond issue would be placed on the November 2004 ballot.)<BR>  <BR>  The bond measure would provide:<BR>  - $10 billion for K-12 school facilities (with roughly half for new construction and a fourth each for modernization and critically overcrowded schools).<BR>  - $2.3 billion for higher education (with $920 million for community colleges and $690 million each for UC and CSU).<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Effect<BR>  <BR>  The cost of these bonds would depend on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid. If the $13.05 billion in bonds authorized by this proposition are sold at an interest rate of 5.25 percent (the current rate for this type of bond) and repaid over 30 years, the cost over the period would be about $26.2 billion to pay off both the principal ($13.05 billion) and interest ($13.15 billion). The average payment for principal and interest would be about $873 million per year.<BR>  [S/BOND]",Proposition 47,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.589,,1

322,California,2002,Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002,"Background<BR>  <BR>  About 150,000 houses and apartments are built in California  each year. Most of these units are built entirely with private dollars. Some, however, receive subsidies from federal, state, and local governments. For some of the units that receive state funds, the state provides low-interest loans or grants to developers (private, nonprofit, and local governments). Typically, there is a requirement that the housing built be sold or rented to Californians with low incomes. Other state programs provide homebuyers with direct financial assistance to help with the costs of a down payment.<BR>  <BR>  The amount of funds that the state has provided to these types of housing programs has varied considerably over time. In 1988 and 1990, voters approved a total of $600 million of general obligation bonds to fund state housing programs (these funds have been spent). Since that time, the state typically has spent less than $20 million annually in General Fund revenues on state housing programs. On a one-time basis, however, the state recently provided more than $350 million in General Fund revenues for these purposes.<BR>  <BR>  Proposal<BR>  <BR>  This measure allows the state to sell $2.1 billion of general obligation bonds to fund 21 housing programs. General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is required to pay the principal and interest on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs over about 30 years.  Most of the funds would go to existing state housing programs. A number of the programs, however, are new, with details to be established by subsequent legislation. The major allocations of the bond proceeds are as follows:<BR>  - Multifamily Housing Programs ($1.11 Billion).<BR>  This measure would fund a variety of housing programs aimed at the construction of rental housing projects, such as apartment buildings. These programs generally provide local governments, nonprofit organizations, and private developers with low-interest (3 percent) loans to fund part of the construction cost. In exchange, a project must reserve a portion of its units for low-income households for a period of 55 years. This measure gives funding priority to projects in already developed areas and near existing public services (such as public transportation).<BR>  - Homeownership Programs ($405 Million).<BR>  A number of the programs funded by this measure would encourage homeownership for low- and moderate-income homebuyers.  Most of the funds would be used to provide down payment assistance to homebuyers through low-interest loans or grants.  Typically, eligibility for this assistance would be based on the household's income, the cost of the home being purchased, and whether it is the household's first home purchase.<BR>  - Farmworker Housing ($200 Million).<BR>  These funds would be used to provide loans and grants to the developers of housing for farmworkers. Program funds would be used for both rental and owner-occupied housing.<BR>  - Other Programs ($385 Million).<BR>  Additional funds would be allocated for the construction of homeless shelters, payments to cities and counties based on their approval of housing units, provision of mortgage insurance for high-risk homebuyers, and capital needs of local code enforcement departments.<BR>  <BR>  Most of the program funds probably would be allocated over a  three- to five-year period. For many of the programs, the measure limits the length of time available for the funds to be spent. If after a specified length of time--between 18 and 48 months--a program's funds are unspent, they would be reallocated to a different housing program.<BR>  <BR>  The measure provides the Legislature broad authority to make  future changes to the programs funded by the measure. The measure also requires the State Auditor to perform periodic audits of the agencies administering the funds and the recipients of the funds.<BR>  <BR>  Impact of Funds.<BR>  The funds from this measure typically would be used together with other government monies to provide housing assistance. In total, the bond funds would provide annual subsidies for about 25,000 multifamily and 10,000 farmworker households.  The funds would also provide down payment assistance to about 60,000 homebuyers and help provide space for 30,000 homeless shelter beds.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Effect<BR>  <BR>  Bond Costs.<BR>  The cost of these bonds would depend on their interest rates and the time period over which they are repaid.  Generally, the interest on bonds issued by the state is exempt from both state and federal income taxes, lowering the payment amounts for the state. Historically, the type of bonds proposed by this measure have not received the federal tax exemption, resulting in a higher interest rate for the bonds. If the bonds were sold at an average interest rate of 6.25 percent (the current rate for this type of bond) and repaid over 30 years, the cost would be about $4.7 billion to pay off both the principal ($2.1 billion) and interest ($2.6 billion). The average payment would be about $157 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  Administrative Costs.<BR>  Several agencies would experience increased costs to administer the various housing programs funded by this measure. Under existing law, a portion of the programs' allocations from the bond funds--up to about $100 million--could be used for these administrative costs. The measure also authorizes some recipients to be charged for administrative costs, thus increasing funds available for this purpose.<BR>  [S/BOND]",Proposition 46,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.575,,1

A portion of these costs would be offset by revenues generated by the improvements, such as fares and tolls.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  California spends about $20 billion a year from a combination of state, federal, and local funds to maintain, operate, and improve its highways, streets and roads, passenger rail, and transit systems. These expenditures are primarily funded on a pay-as-you-go basis from taxes and user fees.<BR>  <BR>  There are two primary state tax sources that fund state transportation programs. First, the state's 18 cent per gallon excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel (generally referred to as the gas tax) generates about $3.4 billion annually. Second, revenues from the state sales tax on gasoline and diesel fuel currently provide about $2 billion a year. Additionally, the state imposes weight fees on commercial vehicles (trucks), which generate roughly $900 million a year. Generally, these revenues must be used for specific transportation purposes, including improvements to highways, streets and roads, passenger rail, and transit systems. These funds may also be used to mitigate the environmental impacts of various transportation projects. Under specified conditions, these revenues may be loaned or used for nontransportation uses.<BR>  <BR>  Since 1990, voters have approved roughly $5 billion in state general obligation bonds to fund transportation. These bond proceeds have been dedicated primarily to passenger rail and transit improvements, as well as to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake safety. As of June 2006, all but about $355 million of the authorized bonds have been spent on projects.<BR><BR>  In addition to state funds, California's transportation system receives federal and local money. The state receives about $4.5 billion a year in federal gasoline and diesel fuel tax revenues for various transportation purposes. Collectively, local governments invest roughly $9.5 billion annually into California's highways, streets and roads, passenger rail, and transit systems. This funding comes mainly from a mix of local sales and property taxes, as well as transit fares. Local governments have also issued bonds backed mainly by local sales tax revenues to fund transportation projects.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure authorizes the state to sell about $20 billion of general obligation bonds to fund transportation projects to relieve congestion, improve the movement of goods, improve air quality, and enhance the safety and security of the transportation system. (See ""An Overview of State Bond Debt"" on page 96 for basic information on state general obligation bonds.)<BR>  <BR>  Figure 1 summarizes the purposes for which the bond money would be used. The bond money would be available for expenditure by various state agencies and for grants to local agencies and transit operators upon appropriation by the Legislature:<BR>  <B>Congestion Reduction, Highway and Local Road Improvements</B>—$11.3 billion—for capital improvements to reduce congestion and increase capacity on state highways, local roads, and public transit for grants available to locally funded transportation projects, as well as for projects to rehabilitate state highways and local roads.   <B>Public Transportation</B>—$4 billion—to make capital improvements to local transit services and the state's intercity rail service. These improvements would include purchasing buses and railcars, as well as making safety enhancements to existing transit facilities.<BR>  <B>Goods Movement and Air Quality</B>—$3.2 billion—for projects to improve the movement of goods—through the ports, on the state highway and rail systems, and between California and Mexico—and for projects to improve air quality by reducing emissions related to goods movement and replacing or retrofitting school buses.<BR>  <B>Safety and Security</B>—$1.5 billion—for projects to increase protection against a security threat or improve disaster response capabilities on transit systems; as well as for grants to improve the safety of rail crossings to seismically retrofit local bridges, ramps, and overpasses; and to improve security and disaster planning in publicly owned ports, harbors, and ferry terminals.<BR>  [S/BOND]",Proposition 1B,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.615,,1

Payments of about $204 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  About 200,000 houses and apartments are built in California each year. Most of these housing units are built entirely with private dollars. Some units, however, receive subsidies from federal, state, and local governments. For instance, the state provides low-interest loans or grants to developers (private, nonprofit, and governmental) to subsidize housing construction costs. Typically, the housing must be sold or rented to Californians with low incomes. Other state programs provide homebuyers with direct financial assistance to help with the costs of a downpayment.<BR>  <BR>  While the state provides financial assistance through these programs, cities and counties are responsible for the zoning and approval of new housing. In addition, cities, counties, and other local governments are responsible for providing infrastructure-related services to new housing—such as water, sewer, roads, and parks.<BR>  <BR>  In 2002, voters approved Proposition 46, which provided a total of $2.1 billion of general obligation bonds to fund state housing programs. We estimate that about $350 million of the Proposition 46 funds will be unspent as of November 1, 2006.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure authorizes the state to sell $2.85 billion of general obligation bonds to fund 13 new and existing housing and development programs. (See ""An Overview of State Bond Debt"" for basic information on state general obligation bonds.) Figure 1 describes the programs and the amount of funding that each would receive under the measure. About one-half of the funds would go to existing state housing programs. The development programs, however, are new—with details to be established by the Legislature. The major allocations of the bond proceeds are as follows:<BR>  <B>Development Programs ($1.35 Billion).</B> The measure would fund three new programs aimed at increasing development. Most of the funds would be targeted for development projects in existing urban areas and near public transportation. The programs would provide loans and grants for a wide variety of projects, such as parks, water, sewage, transportation, and housing.<BR>  <B>Homeownership Programs ($625 Million).</B> A number of the programs funded by this measure would encourage homeownership for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. The funds would be used to provide downpayment assistance to homebuyers through low-interest loans or grants. Typically, eligibility for this assistance would be based on the household's income, the cost of the home being purchased, and whether it is the household's first home purchase.<BR>  <B>Multifamily Housing Programs ($590 Million).</B> The measure also would fund programs aimed at the construction or renovation of rental housing projects, such as apartment buildings. These programs generally provide local governments, nonprofit organizations, and private developers with low-interest (3 percent) loans to fund part of the construction cost. In exchange, a project must reserve a portion of its units for low-income households for a period of 55 years. This measure gives funding priority to projects in already developed areas and near existing public services (such as public transportation).<BR>  <B>Other Housing Programs ($285 Million).</B> These funds would be used to provide loans and grants to the developers of homeless shelters and housing for farmworkers. In addition, funds would be allocated to pilot projects aimed at reducing the costs of affordable housing.   <BR>  The funds would be allocated over a number of years.

About one-half of the funding comes from various local sources, including local sales and property taxes, as well as transit fares. The remainder comes from the state and federal levels, largely from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, and truck weight fees.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the state levies two types of taxes on motor fuels:<BR>  1) An excise tax of 18 cents per gallon on gasoline and diesel fuel. (This is generally referred to as the gas tax.)<BR>  2) A statewide 6 percent tax on the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel (""sales tax"").<BR>  <BR>  <B>Gas Tax.</B> Revenues from the state excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel used on public roads total about $3.4 billion per year. The State Constitution restricts the use of these revenues to specific transportation purposes. These include constructing, maintaining, and operating public streets and highways, acquiring right of way and constructing public transit systems, as well as mitigating the environmental effects of these facilities.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Sales Tax.</B> The state's sales tax on gasoline and diesel fuel currently provides about $2 billion a year. Until 2002, most of the revenues from the state sales tax on gasoline were not used for transportation purposes. Instead, these revenues were used for various general purposes including education, health, social services, and corrections. Proposition 42, which was approved by voters in 2002, amended the State Constitution to dedicate most of the revenue from the sales tax on gasoline to transportation uses. Specifically, Proposition 42 requires those revenues that previously went to the General Fund be transferred to the Transportation Investment Fund to provide for improvements to highways, streets and roads, and transit systems. Proposition 42, however, allows the transfer to be suspended when the state faces fiscal difficulties. Proposition 42 is silent as to whether suspended transfer amounts are to be repaid to transportation.<BR>  <BR>  Since 2002, the state has suspended the Proposition 42 transfer twice because of the state's fiscal condition. In 2003–04, the transfer was suspended partially, and in 2004–05, the full amount of the transfer was suspended. Existing law requires that these suspended amounts, with interest, be repaid to transportation by 2008–09 and 2007–08, respectively.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B>  This measure amends the State Constitution to further limit the conditions under which the Proposition 42 transfer of gasoline sales tax revenues for transportation uses can be suspended. Specifically, the measure requires Proposition 42 suspensions to be treated as loans to the General Fund that must be repaid in full, including interest, within three years of suspension. Furthermore, the measure only allows suspension to occur twice in ten consecutive fiscal years. No suspension could occur unless prior suspensions (excluding those made prior to 2007–08) have been repaid in full.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, the measure lays out a new schedule to repay the Proposition 42 suspensions that occurred in 2003–04 and 2004–05. Specifically, the suspended amounts must be repaid and dedicated to transportation uses no later than June 30, 2016, at a specified minimum annual rate of repayment.<BR>  [CA]",Proposition 1A,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.77,,1

374,California,2008,Alternative Fuel Vehicles and Renewable Energy. Bonds. Initiative Statute.,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Energy and Air Quality Programs.</B></I> The state administers a number of programs to promote renewable energy (such as solar and wind power), alternative clean fuels (such as natural gas), energy efficiency, and air quality improvements. Some programs provide financial incentives, such as grants, loans, loan guarantees, rebates, and tax credits. Funding for these programs has primarily come from fee revenues, although general obligation (GO) bonds more recently have been a funding source for air quality-related incentive programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State and Local Taxes and Local Vehicle License Fee (VLF) Revenues.</B></I> State and local governments levy a number of taxes, including the sales and use tax (SUT). The SUT is levied on the final purchase price of tangible personal items, with a number of specified exemptions. The SUT has two rate components: one state and one local. The state SUT rate is currently 6.25 percent, of which 1 percent is distributed to local governments. The local SUT rate currently varies between 1 percent and 2.5 percent, depending on the local jurisdiction in which the tax is levied. Thus, the overall rate in California varies from 7.25 percent to 8.75 percent. In addition, the state collects an annual VLF on motor vehicles. Most of these VLF revenues are distributed to cities and counties. Currently, the VLF rate is equal to 0.65 percent of a motor vehicle’s depreciated purchase price.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Authority to Sell GO Bonds.</B></I> This measure allows the state to sell $5 billion in GO bonds for various renewable energy, alternative fuel, energy efficiency, and air emissions reduction purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The bond money primarily would (1) provide $3.4 billion for financial incentives to reduce the cost to purchase or lease high fuel economy vehicles and dedicated clean alternative fuel vehicles (primarily rebates for trucks and other medium- and heavy-duty vehicles), and (2) $1.6 billion to fund research, design, development, and deployment of renewable electricity generating technology. The measure allocates the bond funds among four accounts.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Agency Administration of Bond Funds.</B></I> The measure designates various state agencies to administer different components of the measure. Specifically, the State Board of Equalization (BOE) would administer the alternative-fuel vehicle rebates, the Air Resources Board would administer the incentives for alternative-fuel research and development, and the California Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission would administer the renewable energy incentives and the monies available for grants to local governments and public higher education institutions. Regarding BOE’s administration of the rebates, the measure provides that BOE shall calculate the SUT applicable to the sale or lease of a vehicle at the pre-rebate purchase or lease price.<BR>  <BR>  The measure requires each state administering agency to adopt program milestones, provide for annual independent audits, issue annual progress reports, and establish procedures for oversight of the awarding of incentives. The measure also requires that the monies allocated to each bond account be spent within ten years, with reasonable efforts to be made to spend the monies for alternative-fuel vehicle rebates within five years.<BR>  <BR>  Finally, the measure specifies that not more than 1 percent of the funds in each account established by the measure may be used to pay for program administration.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECT</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Bond Costs.</B></I> The cost of these bonds would depend on interest rates in effect at the time they are sold and the time period over which they are repaid. The state would likely make principal and interest payments from the state’s General Fund over a period of 30 years. If the bonds were sold at an average interest rate of about 5 percent, the cost would be about $10 billion to pay off both the principal ($5 billion) and interest ($5 billion). The average payment would be about $335 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on State Sales Tax Revenues.</B></I> The measure provides $2.9 billion for a variety of vehicle-related rebates. The rebates are designed to encourage the purchase or lease of vehicles that, presumably, are more expensive than the vehicles that consumers (individuals and businesses) would purchase or lease in the absence of the rebates. To the extent the rebates result in individuals and/or businesses purchasing or leasing vehicles that are more expensive than those that they would otherwise purchase or lease, state sales tax revenues would increase. In addition, consistent with the experience with other vehicle rebate programs in California, retailers may adjust the sales price upwards to account for the individuals and/or businesses being eligible for a rebate. Such an increase in the sales prices of these products would result in an increase in state sales tax revenues. Finally, rebates will result in lower out-of-pocket expenses for some individuals and/or businesses purchasing or leasing vehicles. If these individuals and/or businesses spend any of these savings on other taxable purchases, this will result in increased SUT revenues.<BR>  <BR>  While the exact amount of increased sales tax revenue that would result from the measure would depend on the quantity and actual selling price of vehicles purchased or leased and other behavioral effects in response to the rebates, we estimate that the amount is potentially in the tens of millions of dollars from 2009 to about 2019.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on Local Revenues.</B></I> The bond-funded incentive programs under the measure would result in the following two effects on local revenues:<BR>  - Increased Local Sales Tax Revenues. As with the measure’s impact on state sales tax revenues discussed above, depending on the quantity and actual selling price of vehicles purchased or leased in response to the rebates, the measure would result in increased sales tax revenues to local governments, potentially in the low tens of millions of dollars from 2009 to about 2019.<BR>  - Increased Local VLF Revenues. As stated above, the measure could result in individuals and/or businesses purchasing or leasing vehicles that are more expensive than those they would otherwise purchase or lease. To the extent that the measure results in the purchase or lease of more expensive vehicles than would otherwise be purchased or leased, it would lead to increased local VLF revenues. While the exact amount of any such VLF revenue increase would depend upon the quantity and actual selling price of any vehicles purchased or leased as a result of the rebates offered by the measure, we estimate the increase in VLF revenues to be potentially in the millions of dollars from 2009 to about 2019.   State Administrative Costs to Implement the Measure. The measure’s 1-percent limit on administrative costs may leave the various state departments with insufficient funds to implement the programs consistent with the provisions of the proposition. To the extent the measure fails to provide adequate funding for its administration, other state funds may face pressure, potentially averaging up to about $10 million annually, to fund implementation of the measure through about 2018–19.",Proposition 10,Initiative,Bond Measures,General,0.405,Statutory,0
375,California,2008,Children’s Hospital Bond Act. Grant Program. Initiative Statute.,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  Children's hospitals focus their efforts on the health care needs of children by providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services to injured, disabled, and sick infants and children. Many children receiving services in these hospitals are from low-income families and have significant health care needs.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 61, which voters approved at the November 2004 statewide general election, authorized the sale of $750 million in general obligation bonds to provide funding for children's hospitals. The eligibility criteria for hospitals to receive funds under Proposition 61 is the same under this measure. As of June 1, 2008, about $403 million of the funds from Proposition 61 had been awarded to eligible hospitals.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure authorizes the state to sell $980 million in general obligation bonds for capital improvement projects at children's hospitals. The measure specifically identifies the five University of California children's hospitals as eligible bond fund recipients. There are additional children's hospitals that are likely to meet other eligibility criteria specified in the measure, which are based on hospitals' performance in the 2001–02 fiscal year. These criteria include providing at least 160 licensed beds for infants and children.<BR>  <BR>  The money raised from the bond sales could be used for the construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, furnishing, equipping, financing, or refinancing of children's hospitals in the state. Eighty percent of the monies would be available to nonprofit children's hospitals and the remaining 20 percent would be available to University of California children's hospitals. The monies provided could not exceed the total cost of a project, and funded projects would have to be completed ""within a reasonable period of time.""<BR>  <BR>  Children's hospitals would have to apply in writing for funds. The California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA), an existing state agency, would be required to develop the grant application. It must process submitted applications and award grants within 60 days. The CHFFA's decision to award a grant would be based on several factors, including whether the grant would contribute toward the expansion or improvement of health care access for children who are eligible for governmental health insurance programs, or who are indigent, underserved, or uninsured; whether the grant would contribute toward the improvement of child health care or pediatric patient outcomes; and whether the applicant hospital would promote pediatric teaching or research programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  The cost of these bonds to the state would depend on the interest rates obtained when they were sold and the time period over which this debt would be repaid. If the $980 million in bonds authorized by this measure were sold at an interest rate of 5 percent and repaid over 30 years, the cost to the state General Fund would be about $2 billion to pay off both the principal ($980 million) and the interest ($933 million). The average payment for principal and interest would be about $64 million per year. Administrative costs would be limited to CHFFA's actual costs or 1 percent of the bond funds, whichever is less. We estimate these costs will be minor.",Proposition 3,Initiative,Bond Measures,General,0.5529999999999999,Statutory,1

377,California,2008,Criminal Justice System. Victims’ Rights. Parole. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.,"<B>OVERVIEW OF PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure amends the State Constitution and various state laws to (1) expand the legal rights of crime victims and the payment of restitution by criminal offenders, (2) restrict the early release of inmates, and (3) change the procedures for granting and revoking parole. These changes are discussed in more detail below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>EXPANSION OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS AND RESTITUTION</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  <BR>  In June 1982, California voters approved Proposition 8, known as the ""Victims' Bill of Rights."" Among other changes, the proposition amended the Constitution and various state laws to grant crime victims the right to be notified of, to attend, and to state their views at, sentencing and parole hearings. Other separately enacted laws have created other rights for crime victims, including the opportunity for a victim to obtain a judicial order of protection from harassment by a criminal defendant.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 8 established the right of crime victims to obtain restitution from any person who committed the crime that caused them to suffer a loss. Restitution often involves replacement of stolen or damaged property or reimbursement of costs that the victim incurred as a result of the crime. A court is required under current state law to order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons not to do so. Sometimes, however, judges do not order restitution. Proposition 8 also established a right to ""safe, secure and peaceful"" schools for students and staff of primary, elementary, junior high, and senior high schools.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Changes Made by This Measure</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Restitution.</B></I> This measure requires that, without exception, restitution be ordered from offenders who have been convicted, in every case in which a victim suffers a loss. The measure also requires that any funds collected by a court or law enforcement agencies from a person ordered to pay restitution would go to pay that restitution first, in effect prioritizing those payments over other fines and obligations an offender may legally owe.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Notification and Participation of Victims in Criminal Justice Proceedings.</B></I> As noted above, Proposition 8 established a legal right for crime victims to be notified of, to attend, and to state their views at, sentencing and parole hearings. This measure expands these legal rights to include all public criminal proceedings, including the release from custody of offenders after their arrest, but before trial. In addition, victims would be given the constitutional right to participate in other aspects of the criminal justice process, such as conferring with prosecutors on the charges filed. Also, law enforcement and criminal prosecution agencies would be required to provide victims with specified information, including details on victim's rights.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other Expansions of Victims' Legal Rights.</B></I> This measure expands the legal rights of crime victims in various other ways, including the following:<BR>  <BR>  - Crime victims and their families would have a state constitutional right to (1) prevent the release of certain of their confidential information or records to criminal defendants, (2) refuse to be interviewed or provide pretrial testimony or other evidence requested in behalf of a criminal defendant, (3) protection from harm from individuals accused of committing crimes against them, (4) the return of property no longer needed as evidence in criminal proceedings, and (5) ""finality"" in criminal proceedings in which they are involved. Some of these rights now exist in statute.<BR>  - The Constitution would be changed to specify that the safety of a crime victim must be taken into consideration by judges in setting bail for persons arrested for crimes.<BR>  - The measure would state that the right to safe schools includes community colleges, colleges, and universities.<BR>  <BR>  <B>RESTRICTIONS ON EARLY RELEASE OF INMATES</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  <BR>  The state operates 33 state prisons and other facilities that had a combined adult inmate population of about 171,000 as of May 2008. The costs to operate the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) in 2008–09 are estimated to be approximately $10 billion. The average annual cost to incarcerate an inmate is estimated to be about $46,000. The state prison system is currently experiencing overcrowding because there are not enough permanent beds available for all inmates. As a result, gymnasiums and other rooms in state prisons have been converted to house some inmates.<BR>  <BR>  Both the state Legislature and the courts have been considering various proposals that would reduce overcrowding, including the early release of inmates from state prison. At the time this analysis was prepared, none of these proposals had been adopted. State prison populations are also affected by credits granted to prisoners. These credits, which can be awarded for good behavior or participation in specific programs, reduce the amount of time a prisoner must serve before release.<BR>  <BR>  Collectively, the state's 58 counties spend over $2.4 billion on county jails, which have a population in excess of 80,000. There are currently 20 counties where an inmate population cap has been imposed by the federal courts and an additional 12 counties with a self-imposed population cap. In counties with such population caps, inmates are sometimes released early to comply with the limit imposed by the cap. However, some sheriffs also use alternative methods of reducing jail populations, such as confining inmates to home detention with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Changes Made by This Measure</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure amends the Constitution to require that criminal sentences imposed by the courts be carried out in compliance with the courts' sentencing orders and that such sentences shall not be ""substantially diminished"" by early release policies to alleviate overcrowding in prison or jail facilities. The measure directs that sufficient funding be provided by the Legislature or county boards of supervisors to house inmates for the full terms of their sentences, except for statutorily authorized credits which reduce those sentences.<BR>  <BR>  <B>CHANGES AFFECTING THE GRANTING AND REVOCATION OF PAROLE</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  <BR>  The Board of Parole Hearings conducts two different types of proceedings relating to parole. First, before CDCR releases an individual who has been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, the inmate must go before the board for a parole consideration hearing. Second, the board has authority to return to state prison for up to a year an individual who has been released on parole but who subsequently commits a parole violation. (Such a process is referred to as parole revocation.) A federal court order requires the state to provide legal counsel to parolees, including assistance at hearings related to parole revocation charges.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Changes Made by This Measure</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Parole Consideration Procedures for Lifers.</B></I> This measure changes the procedures to be followed by the board when it considers the release from prison of inmates with a life sentence. Specifically:<BR>  <BR>  - Currently, individuals whom the board does not release following their parole consideration hearing must generally wait between one and five years for another parole consideration hearing. This measure would extend the time before the next hearing to between 3 and 15 years, as determined by the board. However, inmates would be able to periodically request that the board advance the hearing date.<BR>  - Crime victims would be eligible to receive earlier notification in advance of parole consideration hearings. They would receive 90 days advance notice, instead of the current 30 days.<BR>  - Currently, victims are able to attend and testify at parole consideration hearings with either their next of kin and up to two members of their immediate family, or two representatives. The measure would remove the limit on the number of family members who could attend and testify at the hearing, and would allow victim representatives to attend and testify at the hearing without regard to whether members of the victim’s family were present.<BR>  - Those in attendance at parole consideration hearings would be eligible to receive a transcript of the proceedings.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>General Parole Revocation Procedures.</B></I> This measure changes the board's parole revocation procedures for offenders after they have been paroled from prison. Under a federal court order in a case known as Valdivia v. Schwarzenegger, parolees are entitled to a hearing within 10 business days after being charged with violation of their parole to determine if there is probable cause to detain them until their revocation charges are resolved. The measure extends the deadline for this hearing to 15 days. The same court order also requires that parolees arrested for parole violations have a hearing to resolve the revocation charges within 35 days. This measure extends this timeline to 45 days. The measure also provides for the appointment of legal counsel to parolees facing revocation charges only if the board determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the parolee is indigent and that, because of the complexity of the matter or because of the parolee's mental or educational incapacity, the parolee appears incapable of speaking effectively in his or her defense. Because this measure does not provide for counsel at all parole revocation hearings, and because the measure does not provide counsel for parolees who are not indigent, it may conflict with the Valdivia court order, which requires that all parolees be provided legal counsel.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  <BR>  Our analysis indicates that the measure would result in: (1) state and county fiscal impacts due to restrictions on early release, (2) potential net state savings from changes in parole board procedures, and (3) changes in restitution funding and other fiscal impacts. The fiscal estimates discussed below could change due to pending federal court litigation or budget actions.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State and County Fiscal Impacts of Early Release Restrictions</B><BR>  <BR>  As noted above, this measure requires that criminal sentences imposed by the courts be carried out without being substantially reduced by early releases in order to address overcrowding. This provision could have a significant fiscal impact on both the state and counties depending upon the circumstances related to early release and how this provision is interpreted by the courts.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Prison.</B></I> The state does not now generally release inmates early from prison. Thus, under current law, the measure would probably have no fiscal effect on the state prison system. However, the measure could have a significant fiscal effect in the future in the event that it prevented the Legislature or the voters from enacting a statutory early release program to address prison overcrowding problems. Under such circumstances, this provision of the measure could prevent early release of inmates, thereby resulting in the loss of state savings on prison operations that might otherwise amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>County Jails.</B></I> As mentioned above, early releases of jail inmates now occur in a number of counties, primarily in response to inmate population limits imposed on county jail facilities by federal courts. Given these actions by the federal courts, it is not clear how, and to what extent, the enactment of such a state constitutional measure would affect jail operations and related expenditures in these counties. For example, it is possible that a county may comply with a population cap by expanding its use of GPS home monitoring or by decreasing the use of pretrial detention of suspects, rather than by releasing inmates early. In other counties not subject to federal court-ordered population caps, the measure’s restrictions on early release of inmates could affect jail operations and related costs, depending upon the circumstances related to early release and how this provision was interpreted by the courts. Thus, the overall cost of this provision for counties is unknown.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Potential Net State Savings From Changes in Parole Board Procedures</B><BR>  <BR>  The provisions of this measure that reduce the number of parole hearings received by inmates serving life terms would likely result in state savings amounting to millions of dollars annually. Additional savings in the low tens of millions of dollars annually could result from the provisions changing parole revocation procedures, such as by limiting when counsel would be provided by the state. However, some of these changes may run counter to the federal Valdivia court order related to parole revocations and therefore could be subject to legal challenges, potentially eliminating these savings. In addition, both the provisions related to parole consideration and revocation could ultimately increase state costs to the extent that they result in additional offenders being held in state prison longer than they would otherwise. Thus, the overall fiscal effect from these changes in parole revocation procedures is likely to be net state savings in the low tens of millions of dollars annually unless the changes in the process were found to conflict with federal legal requirements contained in the Valdivia court order.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Changes in Restitution Funding and Other Fiscal Impacts</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Restitution Funding.</B></I> The changes to the restitution process contained in this measure could affect state and local programs. Currently, a number of different state and local agencies receive funding from the fines and penalties collected from criminal offenders. For example, revenues collected from offenders go to counties’ general funds, the state Fish and Game Preservation Fund for support of a variety of wildlife conservation programs, the Traumatic Brain Injury Fund to help adults recover from brain injuries, and the Restitution Fund for support of crime victim programs. Because this initiative requires that all monies collected from a defendant first be applied to pay restitution orders directly to the victim, it is possible that the payments of fine and penalty revenues to various funds, including the Restitution Fund, could decline.<BR>  <BR>  However, any loss of Restitution Fund revenues may be offset to the extent that certain provisions of this initiative increase the amount of restitution received directly by victims, thereby reducing their reliance on assistance from the Restitution Fund. Similarly, this initiative may also generate some savings for state and local agencies to the extent that increases in payments of restitution to crime victims cause them to need less assistance from other state and local government programs, such as health and social services programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Legal Rights of Criminal Victims.</B></I> Because the measure gives crime victims and their families and representatives a greater opportunity to participate in and receive notification of criminal justice proceedings, state and local agencies could incur additional administrative costs. Specifically, these costs could result from lengthier court and parole consideration proceedings and additional notification of victims by state and local agencies about these proceedings.  <BR>  The net fiscal impact of these changes in restitution funding and legal rights of criminal victims on the state and local agencies is unknown.",Proposition 9,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.539,"Statutory, Amendment",1

381,California,2008,"Nonviolent Drug Offenses. Sentencing, Parole and Rehabilitation. Initiative Statute.","<B>SUMMARY</B><BR>  This measure (1) expands drug treatment diversion programs for criminal offenders, (2) modifies parole supervision procedures and expands prison and parole rehabilitation programs, (3) allows inmates to earn additional time off their prison sentences for participation and performance in rehabilitation programs, (4) reduces certain penalties for marijuana possession, and (5) makes miscellaneous changes to state law related mainly to state administration of rehabilitation and parole programs for offenders. Each of these proposals is discussed separately below as well as their combined fiscal effects on the state and local governments.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSALS</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Expansion of Drug Treatment Diversion Programs</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Three-Track System.</B></I> Currently, several programs permit criminal offenders who have committed drug-related offenses, or who have substance abuse problems, to be diverted from prison or jail to other forms of punishment.  This measure expands and largely replaces these existing programs with a new three-track drug treatment diversion program.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>General Effect of These Changes.</B></I> In general, the new Tracks I, II, and III would expand the types of offenders who are eligible for diversion, and expand and intensify the services provided to offenders mainly by increasing the funding available to pay for them. While participants in existing Penal Code 1000 programs must usually pay the out-of-pocket cost of their drug treatment, this measure generally provides funding to counties for participants in treatment under Track I, as well as other tracks. Offenders in all three tracks would generally receive the same types of drug treatment services that assessments determined they needed. This could include treatment in clinics or residential facilities, the dispensing of medication such as methadone, or the provision of mental health services.<BR>  <BR>  However, the three tracks would vary in eligibility requirements, period of participation, level of supervision, and when and how sanctions, such as incarceration in prison or jail, could be imposed on offenders who violate drug treatment diversion program rules or commit new drug-related offenses. The measure permits offenders who have failed in Track I to be shifted to Track II, where they may face more severe sanctions. Similarly, offenders who have failed in Track II may be moved to Track III, where more severe sanctions would be possible. This measure would also require follow-up hearings in court when an offender fails to begin assigned treatment.<BR>  <BR>  Finally, this measure would require the collection and publication of data, specified reports, and research into the effect of this measure and other drug policy issues.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Funding Provisions.</B></I> The 2007–08 Budget Act appropriated $100 million from the General Fund to the Substance Abuse Treatment Trust Fund (SATTF), which was initially created under Proposition 36 to support treatment programs and other allowable activities. This measure appropriates $150 million from the General Fund to the SATTF for the second half of 2008–09 and $460 million in 2009–10, increasing annually thereafter, adjusted for the cost of living and population. After monies are set aside for certain administrative and program costs, the measure designates 15 percent of the remainder for Track I programs, 60 percent for Track II programs, and 10 percent for Track III programs.<BR>  <BR>  A new 23-member state Treatment Diversion Oversight and Accountability Commission would be established under this measure to set program rules regarding the use and distribution of SATTF funds and the collection of data for required evaluations of the programs and program funding needs. The measure generally prohibits the state or counties from using SATTF funds to replace funds now used for the support of substance abuse treatment programs. In addition, it requires that other available private and public funding sources be used whenever possible to pay for treatment before monies from SATTF are spent for these treatment services.<BR>  <BR>  This measure permits SATTF funds to be spent on so-called ""harm reduction"" drug therapies that ""promote methods of reducing the physical, social, emotional and economic harms associated with drug misuse"" and that also ""are free of judgment or blame and directly involve the client in setting his or her own goals.""<BR>  <BR>  <B>New Juvenile Treatment Program Established</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure creates a new county-operated program for nonviolent youth under age 18 deemed to be at risk of committing future drug offenses. The program would receive a set share of SATTF funding (15 percent, after certain implementation costs were deducted) that would be allocated to counties and could be used for various specified purposes, including drug treatment, mental health medication and counseling, family therapy, educational stipends for higher education, employment stipends, and transportation services.<BR>  <BR>  <B>New Limits on Parole Terms</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure reduces the parole term of some parolees but allows longer parole terms for others. It specifies that offenders whose most recent term in prison was for a drug or nonviolent property crime, and who did not have a serious, violent, street gang-related, or sex crime on their record, would be placed on parole supervision for six months. Under the measure, these same parolees could be placed on an additional six months of parole at minimal supervision levels if they failed to complete an appropriate rehabilitation program that was offered to them during the first six months.<BR>  <BR>  This measure also provides longer parole terms for some offenders. Specifically, this measure changes from three to five years the parole terms for any offender whose most recent prison sentence was for a violent or serious felony (such as first-degree burglary or robbery). Some violent sex offenders and other parolees would continue to receive even longer parole terms as provided under existing law.<BR>  <BR>  <B>New Rules for Revocation of Parole Violators</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure requires that parole violations be divided into three types—technical violations, misdemeanors, and felonies—and generally prohibits certain parolees from being returned to state prison for technical or misdemeanor parole violations. This measure would allow revocation of parolees who committed felony violations of parole. It also permits revocation to state prison of those committing technical or misdemeanor violations who were classified high-risk by CDCR, or have violent or serious offenses on their record.<BR>  <BR>  Under this measure, certain parolees who commit parole violations could face such punishments as more frequent drug testing or community work assignments. Some parolees who hide, are repeat violators, or commit misdemeanor parole violations could serve jail time, which under the measure would be at the expense of the state. Parole violators could also be placed in rehabilitation programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Expansion of Rehabilitation Programs for Offenders</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure expands rehabilitation programs for inmates, parolees, and offenders who have been discharged from parole. As regards inmates, the measure requires that all inmates except those with life terms be provided with rehabilitation programs beginning at least 90 days before their scheduled release from prison. The measure directs CDCR to conduct an assessment of the inmate's needs as well as which programs would most likely result in his or her successful return to the community. Parolees are to be provided rehabilitation programs by CDCR tailored to the parolee's needs as determined in their assessment. Offenders would be permitted to request up to a year's worth of rehabilitation services within a year after they are discharged from parole. While these offenders would receive these services from county probation departments, all operational costs of the services would be reimbursed by CDCR under the terms of the measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Other Parole System Changes</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Parole Reform Board Created.</B></I> This measure creates a new 21-member Parole Reform Oversight and Accountability Board with authority to review, direct, and approve the rehabilitation programs and to set state parole policies.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Costs Shifted to State for Drug Diversion of Parolees.</B></I> Currently, some parolees who are diverted to drug treatment receive their treatment services from counties. This measure provides that either CDCR or counties could provide such treatment services for parolees, but that CDCR would have to pay any county operating costs for doing so.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Pilot Programs for Parole Violators.</B></I> This measure directs CDCR to establish pilot projects similar to drug courts  to divert certain parolees who have committed parole violations to treatment and rehabilitation programs. Under the measure, the funding to carry out the programs could come either from the CDCR's budget or separate funding legislation.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Changes in Parole Revocation Procedures.</B></I> This measure requires that parolees receive notice of alleged violations of parole at a BPH hearing held within three business days of their being taken into custody. Consistent with current federal court orders, this measure amends state law to provide all such parolees a right to legal counsel at this hearing.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Credits for Performance in Rehabilitation Programs</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would change state law to permit some inmates who were sentenced to prison for certain drug or nonviolent property crimes to earn more credits to reduce their prison terms than are permitted under current state law. The parole reform board established in this measure would be authorized to award additional credits based upon such factors as the inmate showing progress in completing rehabilitation programs. The measure does not specify nor limit the amount of such additional credits that could be awarded, but it does prohibit them from being awarded to any inmate who has ever been convicted of a violent or serious felony or certain sex crimes.Z<BR>  <BR>  <B>Penalties for Marijuana Offenses Would Become Infraction</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would make the possession of less than 28.5 grams of marijuana by either an adult or a minor an infraction (similar to a traffic ticket) rather than a misdemeanor. Adults would be subject, as they are today, to a fine of up to $100. However, the additional penalties of any kind would be limited under this measure to an amount equal to the fine imposed. (For example, imposition of the maximum $100 fine could result in an additional $100 in penalties.) Persons under age 18 would no longer be subject to a fine for a first offense, but would be required to complete a drug education program. Also, under this measure, fines collected for marijuana possession would be deposited in a special fund to provide additional support of the new youth programs created by this measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Miscellaneous Provisions</B><BR>  <BR>  Other provisions of this measure:<BR>  <BR>  - Reorganize the way CDCR’s rehabilitation and parole programs are administered, and establish a new, second secretary of the department and a chief deputy warden for rehabilitation at each prison;<BR>  - Expand BPH from 17 to 29 commissioners;<BR>  - Require county jails to provide materials and strategies on drug overdose awareness and prevention to all inmates prior to their release;<BR>  - Specify that, except for parolees, adults in drug treatment programs would receive mental health services using funding from Proposition 63, a 2004 ballot measure approved by voters that expanded community mental health services.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Increase in State Costs for Expansion of Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would eventually result in an increase in state costs, potentially exceeding $1 billion annually, mainly for expansion of drug treatment and other services provided for eligible offenders and related administrative costs.<BR>  <BR>  <BR>Savings on State Operating Costs for Prison and  Parole Systems</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would eventually result in savings on state operating costs, potentially exceeding $1 billion annually, due mainly to reductions in prison and parole supervision caseloads. Specifically, this measure could eventually reduce the state prison population by more than 18,000 inmates and reduce the number of parolees under state supervision by more than 22,000.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Net Savings on State Capital Outlay Costs</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would eventually result in one-time net state savings on capital outlay costs for new prison facilities that eventually could exceed $2.5 billion. This net estimate of savings takes into account both (1) likely savings to the state from constructing fewer prison beds because of a reduced inmate population and (2) increased needs for prison program space due to this measure's requirement for expanding in-prison rehabilitation programs. The costs for additional program space could be substantially less if (1) the expected reduction in the inmate population frees up existing prison space now being used to house inmates that could instead be used for operating rehabilitation programs for inmates and (2) the requirement for expanding inmate rehabilitation programs at least 90 days before their release is partly met by reducing program participation by inmates with more than 90 days to serve in prison.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Unknown Net Fiscal Impact on County Operations and Capital Outlay</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>County Operations.</B></I> This measure provides more than $300 million in additional funding annually by 2009–10 through the SATTF for adult and juvenile drug treatment and diversion programs that would be operated mainly by counties. Counties are likely to incur increases in expenditures over time for the programs, including administrative costs, that are generally in line with the increase in the funding that they would receive from the state through the SATTF.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, the measure could result in other increases and reductions in county operating costs and revenues. For example, provisions requiring use of Proposition 63 funds for mentally ill offenders placed in drug treatment diversion programs could increase county costs to the extent that this change prompted counties to replace the funds shifted to these offenders with other local funds. However, the expansion of drug treatment diversion programs in this measure could reduce county costs for jailing offenders for drug-related crimes. The net fiscal impact of these and other factors on counties is unknown and could vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>County Capital Outlay.</B></I> Some counties could, as a result of this measure, face added capital outlay costs for housing parole violators who would be diverted from prison to jails. However, these capital outlay costs could be offset by the diversion of drug offenders from jails to treatment in the community. Other aspects of the measure could also reduce jail populations. The net effect on county capital outlay costs is unknown and would probably vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Other Fiscal Impacts on State and Local Governments</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure could result in other state and local government costs. This would occur, for example, to the extent that additional offenders diverted from prison or jail require government services or commit additional crimes that result in additional law enforcement costs or victim-related government costs, such as government-paid health care for persons without private insurance coverage. Alternatively, there could be increased state and local government revenue to the extent that offenders remaining in the community because of this measure become taxpayers. The magnitude of these impacts is unknown.",Proposition 5,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.405,Statutory,0
382,California,2008,Police and Law Enforcement Funding. Criminal Penalties and Laws. Initiative Statute.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure makes several changes to current laws relating to California’s criminal justice system. The most significant of these changes are described below.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Required Spending Levels for Certain New and Existing Criminal Justice Programs.</B></I> The proposal creates new state-funded criminal justice programs. The measure also requires that funding for certain existing programs be at least continued at their 2007–08 levels. In total, the measure requires state spending of at least $965 million for specified criminal justice programs beginning in 2009–10. This amount reflects an increase in funding of $365 million compared to the amount provided in the 2007–08 Budget Act.<BR>  <BR>  Most of the new state spending required by this measure would be for local law enforcement activities, directed primarily to police, sheriffs, district attorneys, jails, and probation offices. The remaining new state spending would be provided for local juvenile programs, offender rehabilitation, crime victim assistance, and other state criminal justice programs. Specifically, the measure requires new state spending for such purposes as:<BR>  <BR>  - Increased supervision of adult probationers by counties ($65 million);<BR>  - Juvenile facility repair and renovation and the operation of county probation programs for youth ($50 million);<BR>  - City law enforcement efforts to target various crimes, including violent, gang, and gun crimes ($30 million);<BR>  - Prosecution of violent, gang, and vehicle theft crimes ($25 million);<BR>  - The construction and operation of county jails ($25 million);<BR>  - Assisting county sheriff and midsize city police agencies to participate in county, regional, and statewide enforcement activities and programs ($20 million);<BR>  - Programs to assist parolees in their reentry into communities ($20 million).<BR>  <BR>  The measure prohibits the state or local governments from using the new funding to replace funds now used for the same purposes. In addition, the measure requires that future funding for most of these new and existing programs be adjusted annually for inflation.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, this measure redistributes the State Penalty Fund in a way that increases training support for peace officers, corrections staff, prosecutors, and public defenders, as well as various crime victims' services programs, while eliminating the existing transfer of the money to the state General Fund. About $14 million was transferred from the State Penalty Fund to the General Fund in 2007–08. The measure also requires that Youthful Offender Block Grant funds—provided by the state to house, supervise, and provide various types of treatment services to juveniles—be distributed to county probation offices and eliminates existing provisions that permit these funds to be provided directly to drug treatment, mental health, or other county departments.<BR>  <BR>  This measure also creates a new state office in part to distribute public service announcements about crime rates and criminal justice statutes, such as the ""Three Strikes and You’re Out"" law, and establishes a commission to evaluate publicly funded early intervention and rehabilitation programs designed to reduce crime.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increased Penalties for Certain Crimes.</B></I> The measure increases criminal penalties for certain crimes, as well as creates some new felonies and misdemeanors. These changes to penalties include crimes related to gang participation and recruitment, intimidation of individuals involved in court proceedings, possession and sale of methamphetamines, vehicle theft, removing or disabling a GPS device, and firearms possession. These and other proposed increases in penalties would likely result in more offenders being sentenced to state prison or jail for a longer period of time for the crimes specified in the measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Various Changes to State Parole Policies.</B></I> The measure makes several changes to state parole policies. Among the most significant changes to state parole is a reduction in the average parolee caseload of parole agents from about 70 parolees per parole agent to 50 parolees per parole agent. The measure also requires the state to pay the cost of GPS monitoring of sex offenders after their discharge from parole supervision.  Other Criminal Justice Changes. The measure makes several other changes to state laws affecting the criminal justice system. The more significant changes are summarized below:<BR>  <BR>  - <B><I>Gang Databases.</B></I> The measure requires the state to develop two databases related to gang information for the use of law enforcement agencies.<BR>  - <B><I>Hearsay Evidence.</B></I> In general, the testimony of a witness is considered hearsay when it repeats someone's previous statement for the purpose of proving that the content of that statement is true. Hearsay evidence is not admissible in court except under limited circumstances. The measure would expand the circumstances in which hearsay evidence is admissible in court, especially in cases where someone has intimidated or otherwise tampered with a witness.<BR>   - <B><I>Gang Injunction Procedures.</B></I> The measure changes legal procedures to make it easier for local law enforcement agencies to bring lawsuits against members of street gangs to prevent them from engaging in criminal activities and makes violation of such court-ordered injunctions a new and separate crime punishable by fines, prison, or jail.<BR>  - <B><I>Criminal Background Checks for Public Housing Residents.</B></I> Among other state expenditures, this measure provides $10 million annually for grants to governmental agencies responsible for enforcing compliance with public housing occupancy requirements. Agencies that accepted these funds would be required to conduct criminal background checks of all public housing residents at least once per year.<BR>  - <B><I>Temporary Housing for Offenders.</B></I> The measure permits counties with overcrowded jails to operate temporary jail and treatment facilities to house offenders. These temporary facilities would be required to meet local health and safety codes that apply to residences.<BR>  - <B><I>Release of Undocumented Persons.</B></I> This measure prohibits a person charged with a violent or gang-related felony from being released on bail or his or her own recognizance pending trial if he or she is illegally in the United States.<BR>  - <B><I>Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council Membership.</B></I> Each county that receives state funds for certain juvenile crime prevention grant programs currently must have a juvenile justice coordinating council that develops a comprehensive plan on how to provide services and supervision to juvenile offenders. This measure changes who may participate on the council. For example, counties would no longer be required to include representatives of community-based substance abuse treatment programs.<BR>   - <B><I>Juveniles in Adult Court.</B></I> The measure would expand the circumstances under which juveniles would be eligible for trial in an adult criminal court, rather than the juvenile court system, for certain gang-related offenses.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  This measure would have significant fiscal effects on both the state and local governments. The most significant fiscal effects are summarized in Figure 3 and discussed in more detail below. These fiscal estimates could change due to pending federal court litigation or budget actions.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Required Spending Levels for Certain New and Existing Criminal Justice Programs.</B></I> The measure requires state spending for various state and local criminal justice programs totaling about $965 million beginning in 2009–10, an increase of $365 million compared to 2007–08. We estimate that this amount will increase by about $100 million in about five years due to the measure's provisions that require that state funding for certain programs be adjusted each year for inflation. In addition, the redistribution of the State Penalty Fund could result in about a $14 million loss in state General Fund revenues compared to the 2007–08 budget.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increased Penalties for Certain Crimes; Parole Policy Changes.</B></I> Various provisions of this measure would result in additional state costs to operate the prison and parole . These costs are likely to grow to at least a couple hundred million dollars annually after a number of years. These increased costs are mainly due to provisions that increase penalties for gang, methamphetamines, vehicle theft, and other crimes, as well as provisions that decrease parole agent caseloads and require the state to pay for the cost of GPS monitoring for sex offenders discharged from parole supervision.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Capital Outlay Costs.</B></I> The provisions increasing criminal penalties for certain crimes could also result in additional one-time capital outlay costs, primarily related to prison construction and renovation. The magnitude of these one-time costs is unknown but potentially could exceed $500 million.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Trial Courts, County Jails, and Other Criminal Justice Agencies.</B></I> This measure could have significant fiscal effects on state trial courts, county jails, and other criminal justice agencies, potentially resulting in both new costs and savings. The net fiscal effect of its various provisions is unknown as discussed further below.<BR>  <BR>  On the one hand, the measure could result in increased costs to the extent that the additional funding provided for local law enforcement activities results in more offenders being arrested, prosecuted, and incarcerated in local jails or state prisons. There could also be additional jail costs for holding undocumented offenders arrested for violent or gang-related crimes who would no longer be eligible for bail or release on their own recognizance. The measure's provision permitting the use of temporary jail and treatment facilities could result in additional costs to counties to purchase, renovate, and operate such temporary facilities. The magnitude of these costs would depend primarily on the number and size of new temporary facilities utilized by counties.<BR>  <BR>  On the other hand, the measure provides some additional funding for prevention and intervention programs designed to reduce the likelihood that individuals will commit new crimes. To the degree that these programs are successful, they could result in fewer offenders being arrested, prosecuted, and incarcerated in local jails or state prisons than would otherwise occur. Additionally, the measure's provisions increasing criminal penalties for specified crimes could reduce costs related to courts and other criminal justice agencies by deterring some offenders from committing new crimes.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other Impacts on State and Local Governments.</B></I> Other savings to the state and local government agencies could result to the extent that offenders imprisoned for longer periods under the measure's provisions require fewer government services, or commit fewer crimes that result in victim-related government costs. Alternatively, there could be an offsetting loss of revenue to the extent that offenders serving longer prison terms would no longer become taxpayers under current law. The extent and magnitude of these impacts are unknown.",Proposition 6,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.309,Statutory,0
383,California,2008,Redistricting. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <BR>  Every ten years, the federal census counts the number of people living in California. The California Constitution requires the Legislature after each census to adjust the boundaries of the districts used to elect public officials. This process is called ""redistricting."" Redistricting affects districts for the state Legislature (Assembly and Senate), State Board of Equalization (BOE), and the U.S. House of Representatives. The primary purpose of redistricting is to establish districts which are ""reasonably equal"" in population. Typically, redistricting plans are included in legislation and become law after passage of the bill by the Legislature and signature by the Governor.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure amends the California Constitution to change the redistricting process for the state Legislature, BOE, and California members of the U.S. House of Representatives, beginning with the 2010 census.<BR>  <BR>  <B>U.S. House of Representatives Districts</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure maintains the Legislature's role in drawing districts for the U.S. House of Representatives. The measure imposes additional requirements that the Legislature must consider when drawing these districts. Among the new requirements is that the Legislature maintain neighborhoods and ""communities of interest"" within one district to the extent possible. (The term communities of interest is not defined by the measure.)<BR>  <BR>  <B>Legislative and BOE Districts</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure shifts the responsibility for developing redistricting plans for legislative and BOE districts from the Legislature to a new Citizens Redistricting Commission. The measure imposes a number of requirements for the selection of commissioners and their drawing of district boundaries.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Selection of Commissioners.</B></I> The measure establishes a process to select the 14 members to serve on the commission. A registered voter in the state could apply to be a commissioner. The State Auditor, however, would remove applicants from the pool based on various conflicts of interest. For instance, applicants—or an immediate relative—in the past ten years could not have:<BR>  - Been a political candidate for state or federal office.<BR>  - Been a lobbyist.<BR>  - Contributed $2,000 or more in any year to a political candidate.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, applicants could not have changed their political party affiliation in the past five years. Applicants also must have voted in at least two of the last three general elections.<BR>  <BR>  An Applicant Review Panel, comprised of three auditors employed by the state, would narrow the applicants down to 60. The panel would pick the most qualified applicants based on analytic skill, impartiality, and appreciation of California’s diversity. The leaders of the Legislature could strike up to 24 of these names. From the remaining names, the State Auditor would then randomly draw the first eight commissioners. These eight commissioners would select the final six commissioners. The commission would have five members registered with each of the state's two largest political parties (Democrat and Republican) and four members registered with other parties or as independent voters.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Requirements of District Boundaries.</B></I> The measure adds new requirements regarding the drawing of district boundaries by the commission for legislative and BOE districts. These requirements are similar to the measure's new requirements for U.S. House of Representatives districts, as shown in Figure 1. For legislative and BOE districts, the measure also forbids the commission from drawing districts for the purpose of favoring or discriminating against political incumbents, candidates, or parties.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Approval Process.</B></I> In developing a plan, the commission would have to hold public hearings and accept public comment. To approve a redistricting plan, the commission would need at least nine yes votes, including at least three yes votes each from members registered with the two largest political parties and three yes votes from the other members. Once the commission approved a redistricting plan, it would be used for the next decade. The process would be repeated every ten years, with a new 14-member commission for each future redistricting.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Funding.</B></I> Commission members would receive $300 per day, plus reimbursed expenses, in return for their work on the commission. The measure specifies that the Governor and Legislature must make funding available in the state budget to support the selection of the commission, its work, and related costs. Funding would be established at the greater of $3 million or the amount spent in the previous redistricting cycle, adjusted for inflation. (The Legislature spent about $3 million in 2001 from its own budget, which is limited under the California Constitution, to adjust boundaries for all districts.) These funds could be used to establish the application review process, communicate with the public, compensate commissioners, and employ legal and other experts in the field of redistricting.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  <BR>  Under this measure, the Legislature would continue to incur expenses to perform redistricting for U.S. House of Representatives districts. In addition, this measure authorizes funding (outside of the Legislature’s budget) for redistricting efforts related to legislative and BOE districts to be performed by the citizens commission. We estimate that the minimum amount required for 2010 would be about $4 million (the 2001 amount spent on redistricting adjusted for estimated inflation through 2010). Having two entities—the Legislature and the commission—perform redistricting could tend to increase overall redistricting expenditures. Any increase in such redistricting costs, however, probably would not be significant.",Proposition 11,Initiative,Redistricting,General,0.509,"Statutory, Amendment",1

388,California,2008,Renewable Energy Generation. Initiative Statute.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure makes a number of changes regarding RPS and the permitting of electricity generating facilities and transmission lines. Primarily, the measure:<BR>  <BR>  - Establishes additional, higher RPS targets for electricity providers.<BR>  - Makes RPS requirements enforceable on publicly owned utilities.<BR>  - Changes the process for defining ""market price of electricity.""<BR>  - Changes the cost cap provisions that limit electricity provider obligations under the RPS.<BR>  - Expands scope of RPS enforcement.<BR>  - Revises RPS-related contracting period and obligations.<BR>  - Sets a lower penalty rate in statute and removes the cap on the total penalty amount for failure to meet RPS requirements.<BR>  - Directs the use of RPS penalty revenues.<BR>  - Expands Energy Commission’s permitting authority.<BR>  <BR>  Each of these components is described below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Individual Components of Measure</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Establishes Additional, Higher RPS Targets.</B></I> The measure adds two new, higher RPS targets—40 percent by 2020 and 50 percent by 2025. Each electricity provider would need to meet the targets by increasing the share of electricity that it acquires that is generated from renewable energy by at least 2 percent a year, rather than the current 1 percent per year. The measure eliminates the requirement under current law that an electricity provider compensate for failure to meet an RPS target in any given year by procuring additional renewable energy in subsequent years.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Makes RPS Requirements Enforceable on Publicly Owned Utilities.</B></I> The measure requires publicly owned utilities generally to comply with the same RPS as required of IOUs and ESPs, including the current RPS goal to increase to 20 percent by 2010 the proportion of each electricity provider's electricity that comes from renewable resources. The measure also gives the Energy Commission authority to enforce RPS requirements on publicly owned utilities. The measure, however, specifies that the Energy Commission does not have the authority to approve or disapprove a publicly owned utility’s renewable resources energy contract, including its terms or conditions.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Changes Process for Defining ""Market Price of Electricity.""</B></I> The measure makes two major changes in how the market price of electricity is defined for purposes of implementing the RPS. First, the measure shifts from PUC to the Energy Commission responsibility for determining the market price of electricity. Second, the measure adds three new criteria to current-law requirements that the Energy Commission would need to consider when defining the market price of electricity. These criteria include consideration of the value and benefits of renewable resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Changes the Cost Cap Provisions That Limit Electricity Provider Obligations Under the RPS.</B></I> As under current law, the measure provides a cost cap to limit the amount of potentially higher-cost renewable electricity that an IOU must acquire regardless of the annual RPS targets. The measure extends the cost cap limit to ESPs as well. The measure requires that an electricity provider acquire renewable electricity towards meeting annual RPS targets, or face monetary penalties, only as long as the cost of such electricity is no more than 10 percent above the Energy Commission-defined market price for electricity. The potentially higher cost of electricity generated from renewable resources would be recovered by IOUs and ESPs through rates charged to their customers, but subject to this 10 percent cost cap. Publicly owned utilities also could recover these potentially higher costs through rates charged to their customers. However, the costs of publicly owned utilities would not be subject to a cost cap similar to that which applies to IOUs and ESPs.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Expands Scope of RPS Enforcement.</B></I> The measure expands PUC's current RPS-related enforcement mechanisms over IOUs to encompass ESPs. The enforcement mechanisms include review and adoption of renewable resources procurement plans, related rate-setting authority, and penalty authority. The measure grants to the Energy Commission similar RPS-related enforcement authority over publicly owned utilities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Revises RPS-Related Contracting Period and Obligations.</B></I> The measure requires all electricity providers—including publicly owned utilities—to offer renewable energy procurement contracts of no less than 20 years, with certain exceptions. The measure further requires an electricity provider to accept all offers for renewable energy that are at or below the market price of electricity as defined by the Energy Commission.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Sets Lower Penalty Rate in Statute and Removes Cap on Total Penalty Amount.</B></I> The measure includes a formula to determine monetary penalties for an electricity provider that fails to sign contracts for sufficient amounts of renewable energy. The penalty formula is 1 cent per kilowatt hour by which the provider falls short of the applicable RPS target. The measure's formula therefore reflects a penalty rate that is lower than the 5 cents per kilowatt hour penalty rate currently established by the PUC. However, the measure also specifies that neither PUC nor the Energy Commission shall cap the total amount of penalties that may be placed on an electricity provider in any given year.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, the measure states that no electricity provider shall recover the cost of any penalties through rates paid by its customers. However, it is unclear how this prohibition will apply to publicly owned utilities. This is because publicly owned utilities typically have no other source of revenues which could be used to pay a penalty other than rates paid by their customers.<BR>  <BR>  Finally, the measure also specifies the conditions under which PUC or the Energy Commission, as applicable, may waive the statutorily prescribed penalty, such as when the electricity provider demonstrates a ""good faith effort"" to meet the RPS.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Directs Use of Penalty Monies.</B></I> The measure directs that any RPS-related penalties (along with other specified revenues) be used to facilitate, through property or right-of-way acquisition and construction of transmission facilities, development of transmission infrastructure necessary to achieve RPS. The measure specifies that the Energy Commission will hold title to any properties acquired with such funds.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Expands Energy Commission's Permitting Authority.</B></I> The measure expands the Energy Commission's existing permitting authority in two major ways, not limited to the RPS. Specifically, the measure:<BR>  - Grants the Energy Commission the authority to permit new nonthermal renewable energy power plants capable of producing 30 megawatts of electricity or more. The new permitting authority would include related infrastructure, such as electricity transmission lines that unite the plant with the transmission network grid. Currently, this permitting authority rests with local governments.<BR>  - Gives the Energy Commission the authority to permit IOUs to construct new transmission lines within the electricity transmission grid, currently a responsibility solely of the PUC at the state level. It is unclear, however, whether the measure has removed PUC's authority in giving it to the Energy Commission.<BR>  <BR>  The measure specifies that the Energy Commission is to issue a permit for a qualifying renewable energy plant or related facility within six months of the filing of an application. However, the commission is not required to issue the permit within the six-month time frame if there is evidence that the facility would cause significant harm to the environment or the electrical system or in some way does not comply with legal or other specified standards.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Declares Limited Impact on Ratepayer Electricity Bills.</B></I> In its findings and declarations, the measure states that, in the ""short term,"" California's investment in solar and clean energy (which would include the implementation of the measure) will result in no more than a 3-percent increase in electricity rates for consumers. However, the measure includes no specific provisions to implement or enforce this declaration.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  <B>State and Local Administrative Impacts</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increased Energy Commission Costs.</B></I> The measure will increase the annual administrative costs of the Energy Commission by approximately $2.4 million due to new responsibilities and expansion of existing duties. Under current law, the additional costs would be funded by fees paid by electricity customers.<BR>  <BR>  The measure gives the Energy Commission new responsibilities which currently are carried out by PUC—namely, defining the market price of electricity and permitting IOU-related transmission lines. However, significant offsetting reductions in PUC’s costs may not result under this measure. This is because the measure does not amend the State Constitution to delete from PUC's portfolio of responsibilities those which are given to the Energy Commission. To the extent PUC continues to carry out its existing duties, there likely will not be offsetting savings to PUC.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increased PUC Costs.</B></I> In addition, the measure's other requirements will increase annual administrative costs of the PUC by up to $1 million. These additional costs will result from greater workload related to the increased RPS targets. Under current law, these additional costs would be funded by fees paid by electricity customers.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Uncertain Effect on Local Government Administrative Costs.</B></I> The measure shifts from local government to the Energy Commission responsibility for permitting certain renewable energy facilities. As a consequence, the measure will result in administrative cost savings of an unknown amount to local governments. However, local governments may face new costs associated with representing their interests at Energy Commission proceedings to permit renewable energy facilities. It is uncertain whether, on balance, savings to local governments will outweigh costs resulting from this measure. In any event, the overall net impact on local government administrative costs statewide is likely to be minor.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State and Local Government Costs and Revenues</B><BR>  <BR>  The primary fiscal effect of this measure on state and local governments would result from any effect it would have on electricity rates. As discussed below, changes in electricity rates would affect both government costs and revenues.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Unknown Effect on State and Local Government Costs</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Overview.</B></I> Changes in electricity rates would affect government costs since state and local governments are large consumers of electricity. It is unknown, however, how the measure will affect electricity rates, both in the short term and in the longer term. This is because it is difficult to predict the relative prices of renewable resources and those of conventional electricity sources, such as natural gas. The measure could result in higher or lower electricity rates from what they would otherwise be.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Short Term.</B></I> We conclude that the prospects for higher electricity rates are more likely in the short term, based on a comparison of current cost factors for key renewable resources with those for conventional resources. These cost factors include the cost of facility construction and technology, as well as day-to-day operational costs, which include the cost of inputs into the electricity generation process such as fuel. Over the short term at least, these cost factors are more likely to keep the cost of electricity generated from renewable resources, and hence the rates paid by electricity customers for that electricity, above the cost of electricity generated from conventional resources. However, the potential for higher electricity rates to the customer, including state and local governments, might be limited by the measure. This is because the measure caps the cost that privately owned electricity providers must pay for electricity from renewable resources. The cap will be set in relation to the market price of electricity, which will be determined by the Energy Commission. However, because the measure allows the commission substantial discretion in determining the market price of electricity, it is uncertain how the commission will set this cap. In turn, the effect of the cap on the price of electricity paid by customers is unknown.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Long Term.</B></I> In the long run, there are factors that may be affected by the measure that have the potential either to increase or to decrease electricity rates from what they otherwise would be. For example, to the extent that the measure advances development of renewable energy resources in a manner that lowers their costs, electricity customers might experience longer-term savings. On the other hand, the same cost factors that could lead to short-term electricity rates that are higher might also lead to higher long-run electricity rates. To the extent that the measure requires electricity providers to acquire more costly electricity than they otherwise would, they will experience longer-term cost increases. It is unknown whether, on balance, factors that could increase electricity rates over the long term will outweigh those that could decrease electricity rates over the long term. Therefore, the long-term effect of the measure on government costs is unknown.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Unknown Effect on State and Local Government Revenues</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Overview.</B></I> State and local revenues also would be affected by the measure’s impact on electricity rates. This is for two reasons. First, some local governments charge a tax on the cost of electricity use within their boundaries. To the extent that the measure results in an increase or a decrease in electricity rates compared to what they would be otherwise, there would be a corresponding increase or decrease in these local tax revenues. Second, tax revenues received by governments are affected by business profits, personal income, and taxable sales—all of which in turn are affected by what individuals and businesses pay for electricity. Higher electricity costs will lower government revenues, while lower electricity costs will raise these revenues.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Short Term.</B></I> On balance, as explained above, we believe that the prospects for electricity rates that are higher than they would otherwise be are more likely in the short term. However, as also is the case with state and local government costs, the measure's potential to lower state and local government revenues due to higher electricity rates might be limited by the measure's cost cap provision. Thus, for the short term, to the extent that the measure results in higher electricity rates from what they would otherwise be, local utility user tax revenues would increase and state and local sales and income tax revenues would decrease. The overall short-term net effect of the measure on state and local revenues is unknown.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Long Term.</B></I> As for the long run, as explained above, the measure has the potential to either increase or decrease electricity rates. Because the measure's effect on long-term electricity rates is unknown, the measure's effect on long-term government revenues is also unknown.",Proposition 7,Initiative,Energy & Electric Utilities,General,0.355,Statutory,0
389,California,2008,"Safe, Reliable High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act","After the printing of the Voter Information Guide was underway, Proposition 1 was removed from the ballot pursuant to statute. It will be replaced by Proposition 1A on the ballot. A Supplemental Voter Information Guide will be printed to provide voters with the text, analyses, arguments, and other information about the measure required by law. Proposition 1A is on public display until September 18, 2008. This is not a final copy. There may be court ordered changes to Proposition 1A.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Legislative Counsel's summary from the bill:</B><BR>  Existing law, Chapter 697 of the Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 71 of the Statutes of 2004 and Chapter 44 of the Statutes of 2006, provides for submission of the Safe, Reliable High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century to the voters for approval at the November 4, 2008, general election. Subject to voter approval, the act would provide for the issuance of $9.95 billion of general obligation bonds, $9 billion of which would be available in conjunction with any available federal funds for planning and construction of a high-speed train system pursuant to the business plan of the High-Speed Rail Authority, and $950 million of which would be available for capital projects on other passenger rail lines to provide connectivity to the high-speed train system and for capacity enhancements and safety improvements to those lines.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would repeal the above-referenced provisions and enact new provisions submitting a $9.95 billion general obligation bond act to the voters for approval at the November 4, 2008, general election for the same purposes. The bill would revise and recast the previously proposed bond act. The bill would refer to construction of a high-speed train system consistent with the authority's certified environmental impact reports of November 2005 and July 9, 2008, rather than with the final business plan of June 2000. The bill would revise the descriptions of route corridors of the proposed high-speed train system. The bill would require excess revenues from operation of the high-speed train system beyond the amount needed for operating and maintenance costs and financing obligations, as determined by the authority, to be used for construction, expansion, improvement, replacement, and rehabilitation of the high-speed train system. The bill would require that not more than 10% of high-speed rail bond proceeds be used for environmental studies, planning, and preliminary engineering activities and that not more than 2.5% of high-speed rail bond proceeds be used for administrative expenses, except as specified. The bill would generally require the authority to complete various funding plans and financial analyses, as specified, prior to submitting a request for appropriation of bond funds for eligible capital costs and prior to committing bond proceeds for expenditure for construction and real property and equipment acquisition, but would also provide that up to 7.5% of high-speed rail bond proceeds may be used for specified expenditures outside of those requirements. The bill would require the authority to give priority in selecting corridors for construction to those corridors that are expected to require the least amount of bond funds as a percentage of total cost of construction, among other considerations. The bill would provide for the bonds to have a final maturity of not more than 40 years.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would require the bond measure to appear first on the November 4, 2008, general election ballot and to be designated as Proposition 1A. The bill would specify the ballot label and title and summary to be used for the measure.<BR>  <BR>  Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority with specified powers and duties relative to the development and implementation of a high-speed train system. Existing law makes the Department of Transportation responsible for improving and maintaining the state highway system.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would require the authority to revise its business plan by September 1, 2008, as specified, and to submit the revised plan to the Legislature. The bill would also require the authority to establish an independent peer review group for the purpose of reviewing the planning, engineering, financing, and other elements of the authority's plans and issuing an analysis of appropriateness and accuracy of the authority's assumptions and an analysis of the viability of the authority's funding plan for each corridor. This bill would, for any project along the high-speed rail network, authorize the authority to contract with the department to perform project design and engineering services, including construction inspection services, as defined.<BR>  <BR>  Existing law authorizes the authority to, among other things, enter into contracts for the design, construction, and operation of high-speed trains upon approval by the voters of a specified financial plan.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would provide that approval by the voters of the Safe, Reliable High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act constitutes approval of a financial plan for purposes of that provision.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.",Proposition 1A,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.527,,1
390,California,2008,Standards for Confining Farm Animals.  Initiative Statute.,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  Animal agriculture is a major industry in California. Over 40 million animals are raised for commercial purposes on California farms and ranches. California’s leading livestock commodities are milk and other dairy products, cattle, and chickens.<BR>  <BR>  In recent years, there has been a growing public awareness about farm animal production methods, and how these practices affect the treatment of the animals. In particular, concerns have been expressed about some animal farming practices, including the housing of certain animals in confined spaces, such as cages or other restrictive enclosures.<BR>  <BR>  Partly in response to these concerns, various animal farming industries have made changes in their production practices. For example, certain industries have developed guidelines and best practices aimed, in part, at improving the care and handling of farm animals.<BR>  <BR>  State law prohibits cruelty to animals. Under state law, for example, any person who keeps an animal confined in an enclosed area is required to provide it with an adequate exercise area, and permit access to adequate shelter, food, and water. Other laws specifically related to farm animals generally focus on the humane transportation and slaughter of these animals. Depending upon the specific violation, an individual could be found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  Beginning January 1, 2015, this measure prohibits with certain exceptions the confinement on a farm of pregnant pigs, calves raised for veal, and egg-laying hens in a manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. Under the measure, any person who violates this law would be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment in county jail for up to six months.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  Compared to current practice most commonly used by California farmers in the affected industries, this measure would require more space and/or alternate methods for housing pregnant pigs, calves raised for veal, and egg-laying hens. As a result, this measure would increase production costs for some of these farmers. To the extent that these higher production costs cause some farmers to exit the business, or otherwise reduce overall production and profitability, there could be reduced state and local tax revenues. The magnitude of this fiscal effect is unknown, but potentially in the range of several million dollars annually.<BR>  <BR>  Additionally, this measure could result in unknown, but probably minor, local and state costs for enforcement and prosecution of individuals charged with the new animal confinement offense. These costs would be partially offset by revenue from the collection of misdemeanor fines.",Proposition 2,Initiative,Agriculture,General,0.635,Statutory,1
391,California,2008,Transportation Funding. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.,"Scheduled to appear on Feb. 5, 2008 presidential primary ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Prohibits retention of funds earmarked for the Transportation Investment Fund in the General Fund for use unrelated to transportation after 7/1/08. Requires repayment by 6/30/17 of transportation funds retained in the General Fund in years prior to 2007-08. Eliminates General Fund borrowing of specified transportation funds, except for cash-flow purposes (repayment required within 30 days of adoption of budget); current law allows borrowing for three years where Governor declares transfer would cause significant negative fiscal impact on governmental functions and Legislature enacts authorizing statute. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: No revenue or cost effects. Increases stability of funding to transportation in 2007-08 and thereafter; reduces somewhat the state’s flexibility to use specified transportation funds for other (nontransportation) activities.",Proposition 91,Initiative,Budgets,Primary,0.41600000000000004,"Statutory, Amendment",0
392,California,2008,Veterans' Bond Act of 2008,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <BR>  Since 1921, the voters have approved a total of about $8.4 billion of general obligation bond sales to finance the veterans' farm and home purchase (Cal-Vet) program. As of July 2008, there was about $102 million remaining from these funds that will be used to support new loans.<BR>  <BR>  The money from these bond sales is used by the State Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase farms, homes, and mobile homes which are then resold to California veterans. Each participating veteran makes monthly payments to the department. These payments are in an amount sufficient to (1) reimburse the department for its costs in purchasing the farm, home, or mobile home; (2) cover all costs resulting from the sale of the bonds, including interest; and (3) cover the costs of operating the program.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure authorizes the state to sell $900 million in general obligation bonds for the Cal-Vet program. These bonds would provide sufficient funds for at least 3,600 additional veterans to receive loans.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  <BR>  The bonds authorized by this measure would be paid off over a period of about 30 years. If the $900 million in bonds were sold at an interest rate of 5 percent, the cost would be about $1.8 billion to pay off both the principal ($900 million) and the interest ($856 million). The average payment for principal and interest would be about $59 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  Throughout its history, the Cal-Vet program has been totally supported by the participating veterans, at no direct cost to the taxpayer. However, because general obligation bonds are backed by the state, if the payments made by those veterans participating in the program do not fully cover the amount owed on the bonds, the state's taxpayers would pay the difference.",Proposition 12,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.636,,1
393,California,2008,Waiting Period and Parental Notification Before Termination of Minor’s Pregnancy. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  In 1953, a state law was enacted that allowed minors to receive, without parental consent or notification, the same types of medical care for a pregnancy that are available to an adult. Based on this law and later legal developments related to abortion, minors were able to obtain abortions without parental consent or notification.<BR>  <BR>  In 1987, the Legislature amended this law to require minors to obtain the consent of either a parent or a court before obtaining an abortion. However, due to legal challenges, the law was never implemented, and the California Supreme Court ultimately struck it down in 1997. Consequently, minors in the state currently receive abortion services to the same extent as adults. This includes minors in various state health care programs, such as the Medi-Cal health care program for low-income individuals.<BR>  <BR>  <B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <BR>  <B>Notification Requirements</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure amends the State Constitution to require, with certain exceptions, a physician (or his or her representative) to notify the parent or legal guardian of a pregnant minor at least 48 hours before performing an abortion involving that minor. (This measure does not require a physician or a minor to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian.) This measure applies only to cases involving an ""unemancipated"" minor. The measure identifies an unemancipated minor as being a female under the age of 18 who has not entered into a valid marriage, is not on active duty in the armed services of the United States, and has not been declared free from her parents’ or guardians' custody and control under state law.<BR>  <BR>  A physician would provide the required notification in either of the following two ways:<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Personal Written Notification.</B></I>  Written notice could be provided to the parent or guardian personally—for example, when a parent accompanied the minor to an office examination.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Mail Notification.</B></I>  A parent or guardian could be sent a written notice by certified mail so long as a return receipt was requested by the physician and delivery of the notice was restricted to the parent or guardian who must be notified. An additional copy of the written notice would have to be sent at the same time to the parent or guardian by first-class mail. Under this method, notification would be presumed to have occurred as of noon on the second day after the written notice was postmarked.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Exceptions to Notification Requirements</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure provides the following exceptions to the parental notification requirements:<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Medical Emergencies.</B></I> The notification requirements would not apply if the physician certifies in the minor's medical record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the mother's death or that a delay would ""create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.""<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Waivers Approved by Parent or Guardian.</B></I> A minor's parent or guardian could waive the notification requirements and the waiting period by completing and signing a written waiver form for the physician. The parent or guardian must specify on this form that the waiver would be valid either (1) for 30 days, (2) until a specified date, or (3) until the minor's 18th birthday. The form would need to be notarized unless the parent or guardian delivered it personally to the physician.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Notice to Adult Family Member and Report of Abuse.</B></I> The physician could notify an adult family member instead of notifying the minor's parent based on the minor's written statement that (1) she fears physical, sexual, or severe emotional abuse from a parent who would otherwise be notified, and (2) that her fear is based on a pattern of such abuse of her by a parent. The measure defines an adult family member as a person at least 21 years of age who is the grandparent, stepparent, foster parent, aunt, uncle, sibling, half-sibling, or first cousin of the minor. The manner of notice to an adult family member must be consistent with that required for parental notice. In addition, the measure requires the physician to make a written report of known or suspected child abuse to the appropriate law enforcement or public child protection agency. The physician would also be required to include with the notice a letter informing the adult family member about the report of abuse.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Waivers Approved by Courts.</B></I> The pregnant minor could ask a juvenile court to waive the notification requirements. A court could do so if it finds that the minor is sufficiently mature and well-informed to decide whether to have an abortion or that notification would not be in the minor's best interest. If the waiver request is denied, the minor could appeal that decision to an appellate court.<BR>  <BR>  A minor seeking a waiver would not have to pay court fees, would be provided other assistance in the case by the court, and would be entitled to an attorney appointed by the court. The identity of the minor would be kept confidential. The court would generally have to hear and issue a ruling within three business days of receiving the waiver request. The appellate court would generally have to hear and decide any appeal within four business days.<BR>  <BR>  The measure also requires that, in any case in which the court finds evidence of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, the court must refer the evidence to the appropriate law enforcement or public child protection agency.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Reporting Requirements</B><BR>  <BR>  Physicians are required by this measure to file a form reporting certain information to the state Department of Health Services (DHS) within one month after performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor. The reporting form would include the date and facility where the abortion was performed, the minor’s month and year of birth, and certain other information about the minor and the circumstances under which the abortion was performed. The forms that physicians would file would not identify the minor or any parent or guardian by name. Based on these forms, the department would compile certain statistical information relating to abortions performed on minors in an annual report that would be available to the public.<BR>  <BR>  The courts are required by the measure to report annually to the state Judicial Council the number of petitions filed and granted or denied. The reports would be publicly available. The measure also requires the Judicial Council to prescribe a manner of reporting that ensures the confidentiality of any minor who files a petition.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Penalties</B><BR>  <BR>  Any person who performs an abortion on a minor and who fails to comply with the provisions of the measure would be liable for damages in a civil action brought by the minor, her legal representative, or by a parent or guardian wrongfully denied notification. The measure would require such a legal action to commence within four years of the minor's 18th birthday or later, under specified circumstances. Any person, other than the minor or her physician, who knowingly provides false information that notice of an abortion has been provided to a parent or guardian would be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Relief From Coercion</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure allows a minor to seek help from the juvenile court if anyone attempts to coerce her to have an abortion. A court would be required to consider such cases quickly and could take whatever action it found necessary to prevent coercion.<BR>  <BR>  <B>FISCAL EFFECTS</B><BR>  The fiscal effects of this measure on state government would depend mainly upon how these new requirements affect the behavior of minors regarding abortion and childbearing. Studies of similar laws in other states suggest that the effect of this measure on the birthrate for California minors would be limited, if any. If it were to increase the birthrate for California minors, the net cost to the state would probably not exceed several million dollars annually for health and social services programs, the courts, and state administration combined. We discuss the potential major fiscal effects of the measure below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Savings and Costs for State Health Care Programs</B><BR>  <BR>  Studies of other states with laws similar to the one proposed in this measure suggest that it could result in a reduction in the number of abortions obtained by minors within California. This reduction in abortions performed in California might be offset to an unknown extent by an increase in the number of out-of-state abortions obtained by California minors. Some minors might also avoid pregnancy as a result of this measure, further reducing the number of abortions for this group. If, for either reason, this measure reduces the overall number of minors obtaining abortions in California, it is also likely that fewer abortions would be performed under the Medi-Cal Program and other state health care programs that provide medical services for minors. This would result in unknown state savings for these programs.<BR>  <BR>  This measure could also result in some unknown additional costs for state health care programs. If this measure results in a decrease in minors' abortions and an increase in the birthrate of children in low-income families eligible for publicly funded health care, the state would incur additional costs. These could include costs for medical services provided during pregnancy, deliveries, and follow-up care.<BR>  <BR>  The net fiscal effect, if any, of these or other related cost and savings factors would probably not exceed costs of a few million dollars annually to the state. These costs would not be significant compared to total state spending for programs that provide health care services. The Medi-Cal Program alone is estimated to cost the state $14.1 billion in 2007–08.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Health Agency Administrative Costs</B><BR>  <BR>  The state would incur first-year costs of up to $350,000 to develop the new forms needed to implement this measure, establish the physician reporting system, and prepare the initial annual report containing statistical information on abortions obtained by minors. The ongoing state costs to implement this measure could be as much as $150,000 annually.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Juvenile and Appellate Court Administrative Costs</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure would result in increased state costs for the courts, primarily as a result of the provisions allowing minors to request a court waiver of the notification requirements. The magnitude of these costs is unknown, but could reach several million dollars annually, depending primarily on the number of minors that sought waivers. These costs would not be significant compared to total state expenditures for the courts, which are estimated to be $2.2 billion in 2007–08.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Social Services Program Costs</B><BR>  <BR>  If this measure discourages some minors from obtaining abortions and increases the birthrate among low-income minors, expenditures for cash assistance and services to needy families would increase under the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program. The magnitude of these costs, if any, would probably not exceed a few million dollars annually. The CalWORKs program is supported with both state and federal funds, but because all CalWORKs federal funds are capped, these additional costs would probably be borne by the state. These costs would not be significant compared to total state spending for CalWORKs, which is estimated to cost about $5.3 billion in state and federal funds in 2007–08. Under these circumstances, there could also be a minor increase in child welfare and foster care costs for the state and counties.",Proposition 4,Initiative,Abortion,General,0.48,Amendment,0
394,California,2009,Education Funding. Payment Plan.,"Appeared on May 19, 2009 special election ballot.<BR>  Proposition 1B amends the California Constitution related to Proposition 98, as described below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Creates $9.3 Billion ""Supplemental Education"" Obligation.</B> This measure requires the state to make a total of $9.3 billion in supplemental payments to K–14 education. The payments would be made in annual installments, beginning in 2011–12. They would become part of the base budget when calculating the following year's Proposition 98 minimum guarantee.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Supplemental Payments in Place of Maintenance Factor Payments.</B> These payments would replace any payments that the state would otherwise be required to make under current law for maintenance factor obligations created in 2007–08 and 2008–09. The measure, however, does not clarify the uncertainty regarding maintenance factor in Test 1 years for the future.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Distribution of Funds.</B> The measure gives discretion to the Legislature and the Governor regarding how these payments would be distributed between K–12 education and community colleges. For any funds provided to K–12 education, the measure requires that the payments be made for revenue limits. Of the 2011–12 payment, up to $200 million can be provided to school districts with low per-pupil revenue limit amounts to equalize revenue limit payments among districts. All other K–12 payments would be distributed based on districts' per-pupil revenue limit rates. The measure makes no specific requirements on how any money provided to community colleges is to be used.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Measure Linked to Proposition 1A.</B> The funding mechanism for making the supplemental payments established in this measure is provided in Proposition 1A, also on this ballot. That measure establishes a Supplemental Education Payment Account and requires the state to annually deposit 1.5 percent of General Fund revenues into the account, beginning in 2011–12. These funds would be put into the account annually until the entire $9.3 billion in supplemental payments had been provided. If Proposition 1A is not approved by the voters, the provisions of this measure would not go into effect, and there would be no obligation to make $9.3 billion in supplemental payments.",Proposition 1B,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,Special,0.381,Amendment,0
395,California,2009,Elected Officials' Salaries. Prevents Pay Increases During Budget Deficit Years.,"Appeared on May 19, 2009 special election ballot.<BR>  This proposition amends the Constitution to prevent the commission from approving increases in the annual salary of elected state officials in certain cases when the state General Fund is expected to end the year with a deficit.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Official Certification of a Deficit Would Be Required.</B> On or before June 1 of each year, the state Director of Finance (who is appointed by the Governor) would be required to notify the commission in certain cases when the state's finances have weakened. Specifically, the Director would notify the commission if the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties (SFEU) is expected to have a negative balance equal to or greater than 1 percent of the annual revenues of the state General Fund on June 30 (the last day of the state's fiscal year). As described in the analysis of Proposition 1A (also on this ballot), the SFEU is the state's traditional rainy day reserve fund. Currently, 1 percent of General Fund revenues is almost $1 billion.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Certification of the Deficit Would Prevent Raises for Elected State Officials.</B> In years when the commission chooses to adjust state officers' pay and benefits, it already is required to pass a resolution to do this before June 30. These pay and benefit adjustments take effect beginning in December. Under this measure, if the Director of Finance certifies that the SFEU will end the month of June with a deficit of 1 percent or more of General Fund revenues, state officials will not be eligible to receive a salary increase to take effect in December of that year.",Proposition 1F,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,Special,0.743,Amendment,1
396,California,2009,Lottery Modernization Act.,"Appeared on May 19, 2009 special election ballot.<BR>  <B>Measure Allows State to Borrow From Lottery Profits.</B> This measure is one of the major components of the plan approved by the Legislature and the Governor in February 2009 to balance the state budget. The measure makes major changes to the 1984 voter initiative that created the California Lottery. These changes could increase lottery ticket sales and allow the state to borrow $5 billion in the 2009–10 fiscal year from future lottery profits. In addition to borrowing this $5 billion, the state also could borrow more from lottery profits in future years. Under the measure, lottery profits now dedicated to schools and colleges would be used to pay back the borrowing. The measure would increase state payments to education from the state General Fund to make up for the loss of these lottery payments.",Proposition 1C,Legislative Referendum,Education: PreK-12,Special,0.35600000000000004,Amendment,0
397,California,2009,Mental Health Services Funding. Temporary Reallocation.  Helps Balance State Budget.,"Appeared on May 19, 2009 special election ballot.<BR>  This measure allows for the temporary redirection of some Proposition 63 funds to support EPSDT mental health services. Specifically, $226.7 million in Proposition 63 funds would be redirected in 2009–10, and between $226.7 million and $234 million would be redirected in 2010–11, to support EPSDT. In effect, these Proposition 63 revenues would be used to offset state costs that would otherwise be borne by the General Fund, thereby achieving savings to help address the state's current budgetary problem",Proposition 1E,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,Special,0.335,Amendment,0
398,California,2009,Protects Children's Services Funding. Helps Balance State Budget.,"Appeared on May 19, 2009 special election ballot.<BR>  This measure temporarily redirects a significant portion of Proposition 10 funds to achieve budgetary savings and makes permanent changes to state and local commission operations, as discussed below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Temporary Redirections of Funding to State Programs for Children.</B> This measure amends the California Children and Families Act to temporarily allow Proposition 10 revenues to be used to fund other state health and human services programs for children up to age five. In effect, these Proposition 10 revenues would be used to offset existing state General Fund costs, thereby achieving savings to help address the state's current budgetary problem. The measure achieves these state General Fund savings in two ways:<BR>  - By redirecting up to $340 million of available unspent reserves held by the state commission as of July 1, 2009.<BR>  - By temporarily redirecting a portion of future Proposition 10 revenues. Specifically, from 2009–10 through 2013–14, this measure would divert annually $268 million in Proposition 10 funds.

400,California,2010,Allows Auto Insurance Companies to Base Their Prices in Part on a Driver's History of Insurance Coverage. Initiative Statute.,"June 8, 2010 primary<BR>  Permits companies to reduce or increase cost of insurance depending on whether driver has a history of continuous insurance coverage.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B>  Automobile insurance is one of the major types of insurance purchased by California residents. It accounted for about $19.7 billion (36 percent) of all premiums collected by California insurers in 2008. Among the types of automobile insurance coverage available is bodily injury liability, which provides protection in the event a motorist physically injures someone else.<BR>  <BR>  <I>State Regulation of Automobile Insurance.</I> In 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, which requires the Insurance Commissioner to review and approve rate changes for certain types of insurance, including automobile insurance, before changes to the rates can take effect. Proposition 103 also requires that rates and premiums for automobile insurance policies be set by applying the following rating factors in decreasing order of importance: (1) the insured's driving safety record, (2) the number of miles they drive each year, and (3) the number of years they have been driving.<BR>  <BR>  The Insurance Commissioner may adopt additional rating factors to determine automobile rates and premiums. Currently, 16 optional rating factors may be used for these purposes. For example, insurance companies may provide discounts to individuals for being long-term customers of theirs. Insurance companies are prohibited, however, from offering this kind of discount to new customers who switch to them from other insurers.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, Proposition 103 contains a provision related to individuals who were previously uninsured. Specifically, Proposition 103 prohibits insurance companies from using the information that an individual did not previously have automobile insurance to: (1) determine whether the individual is eligible for coverage or (2) decide the premiums charged for coverage.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Insurance Premium Tax.</I> Insurance companies doing business in California currently pay an insurance premium tax instead of the state corporate income tax. The tax is based on the amount of insurance premiums earned in the state each year for automobile insurance as well as for other types of insurance coverage. In 2008, insurance companies paid about $247 million in premium tax revenues on automobile policies in California. These revenues are deposited into the state General Fund.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposal</B>  This measure amends Proposition 103 to allow an insurance company to offer a ""continuous coverage"" discount on automobile insurance policies to new customers who switch their coverage from another insurer. If an insurance company chooses to provide such a discount, it must be based on the length of time the customer continuously had bodily injury liability coverage. Customers would generally be eligible for this discount so long as their coverage had not lapsed for more than 90 days in the past five years, except if any lapse was the result of a failure to pay the premium. Also, customers would still be eligible for this kind of discount under the measure if a lapse in coverage was due to military service in another country. Children residing with a parent could qualify for the discount based on their parent's eligibility.",Proposition 17,Initiative,Insurance,Primary,0.48100000000000004,Statutory,0
401,California,2010,California Fair Elections Act,"Scheduled for the June 8, 2010 primary<BR>  <BR>  Repeals ban on public funding of political campaigns. Creates a voluntary system for candidates for Secretary of State to qualify for a public campaign grant if they agree to limitations on spending and private contributions. Each candidate demonstrating enough public support would receive same amount. Participating candidates would be prohibited from raising or spending money beyond the grant. There would be strict enforcement and accountability. Funded by voluntary contributions and a biennial fee on lobbyists, lobbying firms, and lobbyist employers. Fiscal Impact: Increased revenues (mostly from charges related to lobbyists) totaling over $6 million every four years. These funds would be spent on public financing for campaigns of Secretary of State candidates for the 2014 and 2018 elections.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  <I>Ban on Public Funds to Pay for Campaigns.</I> State law bans the use of public funds for political candidates' campaigns. This ban extends to all elected offices at the state level and most elected offices at the local level. (Using powers that they already have under the State Constitution, a small number of charter cities have created programs for the public financing of candidates for certain local offices.)<BR>  <BR>  <I>Entities That Oversee Campaign Finance Laws.</I> The state's campaign finance laws are administered by the Fair Political Practices Commission (commission) and the Secretary of State. Under state law, individuals and groups must disclose how much money has been given, received, and spent on political campaigns. This information is available to the public on the Secretary of State's Web site. The commission monitors candidates and donors, and it can assess fines on candidates and donors who violate election laws.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Lobbyist Registration Administered by Secretary of State.</I> The Secretary of State is elected statewide every four years and serves as the state's chief elections official. The Secretary of State also has other duties, such as monitoring activities of lobbyists. Lobbying is the act of communicating directly with public officials in order to influence governmental actions on behalf of the lobbyist's employer or client. Every two years, lobbyists, lobbying firms, and lobbyist employers must register with the Secretary of State. There is currently a $25 fee related to each lobbyist to cover the administrative expenses of registration.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposal</B><BR>  This measure:<BR>  1) Lifts the ban on public funding for political campaigns.<BR>  2) Establishes a public funding system for campaigns for the office of Secretary of State.<BR>  3)Requires lobbyists to pay higher charges for this public campaign funding.",Proposition 15,Legislative Referendum,Ethics/Lobbying/Campaign Finance,Primary,0.42700000000000005,Statutory,0
402,California,2010,Changes California Law to Legalize Marijuana and Allow It to Be Regulated and Taxed.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure changes state law to (1) legalize the possession and cultivation of limited amounts of marijuana for personal use by individuals age 21 or older, and (2) authorize various commercial marijuana–related activities under certain conditions. Despite these changes to state law, these marijuana–related activities would continue to be prohibited under federal law. These federal prohibitions could still be enforced by federal agencies. It is not known to what extent the federal government would continue to enforce them. Currently, no other state permits commercial marijuana-related activities for non-medical purposes.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Legalization of Marijuana Possession and Cultivation for Personal Use</B><BR>  Under the measure, persons age 21 or older generally may (1) possess, process, share or transport up to one ounce of marijuana; (2) cultivate marijuana on private property in an area up to 25 square feet per private residence or parcel; (3) possess harvested and living marijuana plants cultivated in such an area; and (4) possess any items or equipment associated with the above activities. The possession and cultivation of marijuana must be solely for an individual’s personal consumption and not for sale to others, and consumption of marijuana would only be permitted in a residence or other ""non–public place."" (One exception is that marijuana could be sold and consumed in licensed establishments, as discussed below.) The state and local governments could also authorize the possession and cultivation of larger amounts of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  State and local law enforcement agencies could not seize or destroy marijuana from persons in compliance with the measure. In addition, the measure states that no individual could be punished, fined, or discriminated against for engaging in any conduct permitted by the measure. However, it does specify that employers would retain existing rights to address consumption of marijuana that impairs an employee's job performance.<BR>  <BR>  This measure sets forth some limits on marijuana possession and cultivation for personal use. For example, the smoking of marijuana in the presence of minors is not permitted. In addition, the measure would not change existing laws that prohibit driving under the influence of drugs or that prohibit possessing marijuana on the grounds of elementary, middle, and high schools. Moreover, a person age 21 or older who knowingly gave marijuana to a person age 18 through 20 could be sent to county jail for up to six months and fined up to $1,000 per offense. (The measure does not change existing criminal laws which impose penalties for adults who furnish marijuana to minors under the age of 18.)<BR>  <BR>  <B>Authorization of Commercial Marijuana Activities</B><BR>  The measure allows local governments to authorize, regulate, and tax various commercial marijuana–related activities. As discussed below, the state also could authorize, regulate, and tax such activities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Regulation.</B></I> The measure allows local governments to adopt ordinances and regulations regarding commercial marijuana–related activities—including marijuana cultivation, processing, distribution, transportation, and retail sales. For example, local governments could license establishments that could sell marijuana to persons 21 and older. Local governments could regulate the location, size, hours of operation, and signs and displays of such establishments. Individuals could transport marijuana from a licensed marijuana establishment in one locality to a licensed establishment in another locality, regardless of whether any localities in between permitted the commercial production and sale of marijuana. However, the measure does not permit the transportation of marijuana between California and another state or country. An individual who was licensed to sell marijuana to others in a commercial establishment and who negligently provided marijuana to a person under 21 would be banned from owning, operating, being employed by, assisting, or entering a licensed marijuana establishment for one year. Local governments could also impose additional penalties or civil fines on certain marijuana–related activities, such as for violation of a local ordinance limiting the hours of operation of a licensed marijuana establishment.<BR>  <BR>  Whether or not local governments engaged in this regulation, the state could, on a statewide basis, regulate the commercial production of marijuana. The state could also authorize the production of hemp, a type of marijuana plant that can be used to make products such as fabric and paper.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Taxation.</B></I> The measure requires that licensed marijuana establishments pay all applicable federal, state, and local taxes and fees currently imposed on other similar businesses. In addition, the measure permits local governments to impose new general, excise, or transfer taxes, as well as benefit assessments and fees, on authorized marijuana–related activities. The purpose of such charges would be to raise revenue for local governments and/or to offset any costs associated with marijuana regulation. In addition, the state could impose similar charges.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <B><I>Federal Law.</I></B> Federal laws classify marijuana as an illegal substance and provide criminal penalties for various activities relating to its use. These laws are enforced by federal agencies that may act independently or in cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State Law and Proposition 215.</I></B> Under current state law, the possession, cultivation, or distribution of marijuana generally is illegal in California. Penalties for marijuana–related activities vary depending on the offense. For example, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, while selling marijuana is a felony and may result in a prison sentence.<BR>  <BR>  In November 1996, voters approved Proposition 215, which legalized the cultivation and possession of marijuana in California for medical purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2005, however, that federal authorities could continue to prosecute California patients and providers engaged in the cultivation and use of marijuana for medical purposes. Despite having this authority, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in March 2009 that the current administration would not prosecute marijuana patients and providers whose actions are consistent with state medical marijuana laws.",Proposition 19,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.465,Statutory,0
403,California,2010,Changes Legislative Vote Requirement to Pass a Budget from Two-Thirds to a Simple Majority. Retains Two-Thirds Vote Requirement for Taxes. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <B><I>Lowers Legislative Vote Requirements for the Budget Bill and Related Legislation.</B></I> This measure amends the Constitution to lower the vote requirement necessary for each house of the Legislature to pass a budget bill and send it to the Governor. Specifically, the vote requirement would be lowered from two–thirds to a majority (50 percent plus one) of each house of the Legislature. The lower vote requirement also would apply to trailer bills that appropriate funds and are identified by the Legislature “as related to the budget in the budget bill.” Both the budget bill and these trailer bills would take effect immediately after being signed by the Governor (or on a later date specified in the bill). A two–thirds vote of the Legislature would still be required to override any veto by the Governor. This measure’s constitutional provisions do not specifically address the legislative vote requirement for increasing state tax revenues, but the measure states that its intent is not to change the existing two-thirds vote requirement regarding state taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Loss of Pay and Reimbursements by Legislators.</B></I> In any year when the Legislature has not sent a budget bill to the Governor by June 15, this measure would prohibit Members of the Legislature from collecting any salary or reimbursements for travel or living expenses. This prohibition would be in effect from June 15 until the day that a budget is presented to the Governor. These salaries and expenses could not be paid to legislators at a later date.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <B><I>Process for Passing a Budget.</B></I> The State Constitution gives the Legislature the power to appropriate (that is, allow the spending of) state funds. The annual state budget is the Legislature’s primary method of authorizing state expenses for a fiscal year (which runs from July 1 to June 30). The Constitution requires that the Governor propose a budget by January 10 for the next fiscal year. Each of the two houses of the Legislature (the State Assembly and the State Senate) then is required to pass the annual budget bill by June 15 and send it to the Governor. The Governor may either sign the budget approved by the Legislature or veto (reject) all or a part of it. By a two–thirds (67 percent) vote in each house of the Legislature, a veto by the Governor may be overridden. While the Constitution has a date by which the Legislature must pass a budget, it does not have a specific date by which a final budget must be put into law.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Two–Thirds Vote Requirement for Passage of State Budget.</B></I> The Constitution requires a two–thirds vote of each house of the Legislature for the passage of ""urgency"" measures that take effect immediately, bills that increase state tax revenues, and General Fund appropriations (except appropriations for public schools). Because the state budget includes General Fund appropriations and needs to take effect immediately, it requires a two–thirds vote for passage. Certain budget actions, such as a decision to change the services that a state department is mandated to provide, require changing state law. These changes often are included in “trailer bills” that accompany passage of the budget each year. In general, bills passed by the Legislature take effect on January 1 of the next year. In order for trailer bills to take effect immediately, however, they must be passed by a two–thirds vote of each house of the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Late Budgets.</B></I> Since 1980, the Legislature has met its June 15 constitutional deadline for sending a budget to the Governor five times. During that same period, a final budget—passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor—was in place prior to the July 1 start of the fiscal year on ten occasions, including three times since 2000. When a fiscal year begins without a state budget in place, some state expenses are not paid as scheduled. For example, state elected officials (such as the Governor and Members of the Legislature) have not received salaries after July 1 until a final budget is in place. Salary payments withheld from these officials have been paid in full when the final budget goes into effect.",Proposition 25,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.551,Amendment,1
404,California,2010,Elections. Increase Right to Participate in Primary Elections.,"Scheduled for the June 8, 2010 primary<BR>  Changes the primary election process for congressional, statewide, and legislative races. Allows all voters to choose any candidate regardless of the candidate's or voter's political party preference. Ensures that the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes will appear on the general election ballot regardless of party preference. Fiscal Impact: No significant net change in state and local government costs to administer elections.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  <I>Primary and General Elections.</I> California generally holds two statewide elections in even-numbered years to elect candidates to state and federal offices-—a primary election (in June) and a general election (in November). These elections (such as those for Governor and Members of Congress) are partisan, which means that most candidates are associated with a political party. For these partisan offices, the results of a primary election determine each party's nominee for the office. The candidate receiving the most votes in a party primary election is that party's nominee for the general election. In the general election, voters choose among all of the parties' nominees, as well as any independent candidates. (Independent candidates-—those not associated with a party-—do not participate in primary elections.) The winner of the general election then serves a term in that office.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Ballot Materials Under Current Primary System.</I> For every primary election, each county prepares a ballot and related materials for each political party. Those voters affiliated with political parties receive their party's ballot. These party ballots include partisan offices, nonpartisan offices, and propositions. Voters with no party affiliation receive ballots related only to nonpartisan offices and propositions. Parties, however, may allow voters with no party affiliation to receive their party's ballot.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Partisan Statewide Elections in California.</I> Partisan elections for state office include those for the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Controller, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner, Attorney General, the 120 members of the Legislature, and four members of the State Board of Equalization. (The Superintendent of Public Instruction is a nonpartisan state office.) Partisan elections also are held for federal offices including President, Vice President, and Members of Congress.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposal</B><BR>  This measure, which amends the State Constitution, changes the election process for most state and federal offices. Its provisions and related legislation would take effect for elections after January 1, 2011.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Creates a Top-Two Primary Election.</I> This measure creates a single ballot for primary elections for those congressional and state elective offices. Candidates would indicate for the ballot either their political party (the party chosen on their voter registration) or no party preference. All candidates would be listed-—including independent candidates, who now would appear on the primary ballot. Each voter would cast his or her vote using this single primary ballot. A voter registered with the Republican Party, for example, would be able to vote in the primary election for a candidate registered as a Democrat, a candidate registered as a Republican, or any other candidate. The two candidates with the highest number of votes in the primary election—-regardless of their party preference—-would advance to compete in the general election. In fact, the two candidates in the general election could have the same party preference.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Does Not Affect Presidential Elections and Political Party Leadership Positions.</I> Under this measure, there would still be partisan primary elections for presidential candidates and political party offices (including party central committees, party officials, and presidential delegates).",Proposition 14,Legislative Referendum,Elections,Primary,0.5379999999999999,Amendment,1
405,California,2010,Eliminates State Commission on Redistricting. Consolidates Authority for Redistricting with Elected Representatives. Initiative Constitutional Amendment and Statute.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure amends the Constitution and other state laws to change the way that district boundaries are determined for the State Assembly, State Senate, BOE, and California's seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Legislative and BOE Redistricting Returns to Legislature.</B></I> This measure returns authority to draw district boundaries for the State Assembly, State Senate, and BOE to the Legislature. The responsibility to determine congressional districts would remain with the Legislature. Under this measure, therefore, district boundaries for all of these congressional and state offices would be determined in bills passed by the Legislature. The Citizens Redistricting Commission that was created by Proposition 11 would be eliminated. As a result, the process currently underway for appointing members of that commission would end, and the Legislature would undertake the redistricting resulting from the 2010 and future censuses.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>New Requirements for Redistricting Boundaries and Process.</B></I> Proposition 27 creates certain requirements for district boundaries. Under this measure, the population of each district would be almost equal with other districts for the same office (with a difference in population of no greater than one person). This measure further requires the Legislature to hold hearings before and after district boundary maps are created, as well as provide the public access to certain redistricting data.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Deletes Some Existing Requirements.</B></I> This measure also deletes some existing rules on what must be considered during the redistricting process, such as requirements related to:<BR>  - Not favoring or discriminating against political parties, incumbents, or political candidates.<BR>  - Developing geographically compact districts.<BR>  - Placing two Assembly districts together within one Senate district and placing ten Senate districts together within one BOE district.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Two Redistricting–Related Measures on This Ballot.</B></I> In addition to this measure, another measure on the November 2010 ballot—Proposition 20—concerns redistricting issues. Key provisions of these two propositions, as well as current law, are summarized in Figure 1. If both of these measures are approved by voters, the proposition receiving the greater number of ""yes"" votes would be the only one to go into effect.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  In a process known as ""redistricting,"" the State Constitution requires that the state adjust the boundary lines of districts once every ten years following the federal census for the State Assembly, State Senate, State Board of Equalization (BOE), and California’s congressional districts for the U.S. House of Representatives. To comply with federal law, redistricting must establish districts which are roughly equal in population.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Recent Changes to State Legislature and BOE Redistricting.</B></I> In the past, district boundaries for all of the offices listed above were determined in bills that became law after they were approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. On some occasions, when the Legislature and the Governor were unable to agree on redistricting plans, the California Supreme Court performed the redistricting.<BR>  <BR>  In November 2008, voters passed Proposition 11, which created the Citizens Redistricting Commission to establish new district boundaries for the State Assembly, State Senate, and BOE beginning after the 2010 census. To be established once every ten years, the commission will consist of 14 registered voters—5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 4 others—who apply for the position and are chosen according to specified rules.<BR>  <BR>  When the commission sets district boundaries, it must meet the requirements of federal law and other requirements, such as not favoring or discriminating against political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. In addition, the commission is required, to the extent possible, to adopt district boundaries that:<BR>  - Maintain the geographic integrity of any city, county, neighborhood, and “community of interest” in a single district. (The commission is responsible for defining “communities of interest” for its redistricting activities.)<BR>  - Develop geographically compact districts.<BR>  - Place two Assembly districts together within one Senate district and place ten Senate districts together within one BOE district.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Current Congressional Redistricting Process.</B></I> Currently, California is entitled to 53 of the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Proposition 11 did not change the redistricting process for these 53 congressional seats. Currently, therefore, redistricting plans for congressional seats are included in bills that are approved by the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 11, however, did make some changes to the requirements that the Legislature must meet in drawing congressional districts. The Legislature—like the commission—now must attempt to draw geographically compact districts and maintain geographic integrity of localities, neighborhoods, and communities of interest, as defined by the Legislature. Proposition 11, however, does not prohibit the Legislature from favoring or discriminating against political parties, incumbents, or political candidates when drawing congressional districts.",Proposition 27,Initiative,Redistricting,General,0.405,"Statutory, Amendment",0
406,California,2010,Establishes $18 Annual Vehicle License Surcharge to Help Fund State Parks and Wildlife Programs and Grants Free Admission to All State Parks to Surcharged Vehicles.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <B><I>Imposition of an $18 Surcharge on Vehicle Registrations.</B></I> This measure places an $18 annual surcharge on all vehicles registered on or after January 1, 2011, except for commercial vehicles, trailers, and trailer coaches. The surcharge would be collected when annual vehicle registration fees are paid. These surcharge revenues would be deposited into the newly created State Parks and Wildlife Conservation Trust Fund. The measure expressly prohibits these funds from being used for purposes other than state parks and wildlife conservation.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Free Day–Use Entry to All State Parks for Surcharge Payers.</B></I> Typically, most state parks charge a vehicle day–use fee that covers entry into the park and parking. Currently, this single fee is in the range of $5 to $15 per day depending on the park and the time of year. Under this measure, all California vehicles subject to the surcharge would have free vehicle admission, parking, and day–use at all units of the state parks system, including state parks currently operated by local entities, as well as to other specified state lands and wildlife areas. State parks would still be able to charge fees for camping, tours, and other activities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Allocation of Funds.</B></I> This measure allows up to 1 percent of the revenues deposited into the trust fund to be used for certain administrative and oversight activities, discussed further below. The remaining funds in the trust fund would be allocated each year, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to various park and wildlife conservation–related programmatic purposes. These surcharge revenues would be allocated as follows:<BR>  <BR>  -- <B><I>Operations, Maintenance, and Development of State Parks.</B></I> Eighty–five percent of the funds would be allocated to DPR for the operations, maintenance, and development of the state parks system. From this amount, the department would award grants to local entities to replace the loss of day–use fees at locally operated state park units. (As we discuss below, some fee revenues would no longer be collected because this measure would now allow certain vehicles free access to these parks.) From this amount, the department would also provide grants to public agencies for urban river parkways to provide recreational benefits to underserved urban communities. The measure requires DPR to develop a strategic plan to improve access to the state parks system for underserved groups and regions of the state.<BR>  -- <B><I>Management and Operation of DFG Lands.</B></I> Seven percent of the funds would be allocated to DFG for the management and operation of wildlife refuges, ecological reserves, and other DFG lands.   Other Wildlife Conservation Activities. Additional funds would be allocated to other wildlife conservation activities, in some cases for state–operated programs but in other cases for grants to local agencies. Four percent would be allocated to the Ocean Protection Council, 2 percent to state conservancies, and 2 percent to the Wildlife Conservation Board.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Administration and Oversight.</B></I> As discussed above, this measure allows for up to 1 percent of annual revenues to be used for collection, administration, auditing, and oversight of the trust fund. The DMV would collect the surcharge and would deposit it into the trust fund. The measure requires the State Auditor to conduct annual audits of expenditures from the fund to be reported to the Legislature and made publicly available. It also directs the Secretary for Natural Resources to establish a Citizens Oversight Committee that would review the audits and issue reports on how the measure is being implemented and its effectiveness in protecting state parks and natural resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <B><I>The State Park System and State Wildlife Conservation Agencies.</B></I> California has 278 state parks, of which 246 are operated and maintained by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) and 32 by local entities. Other state departments, such as the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) and various state conservancies, own and maintain other lands for wildlife conservation purposes. The State Wildlife Conservation Board acquires property and provides grants for property acquisition to state and local entities for wildlife conservation purposes. The Ocean Protection Council is a state agency responsible for coordinating state activities to protect ocean resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Funding for State Parks and Wildlife Conservation.</B></I> Over the last five years, state funding for the operation of state parks has been around $300 million annually. Of this amount, about $150 million has come from the General Fund, with the balance coming largely from park user fees (such as admission, camping, and other use fees) and state gasoline tax revenues. The development of new state parks and capital improvements to existing parks are largely funded from bond funds that have been approved in the past by voters. There is a significant backlog of maintenance projects in state parks, which have no dedicated annual funding source. The DPR also administers grant programs for local parks, funded largely through bond funds.<BR>  <BR>  Wildlife conservation programs in various other state departments, such as DFG, are funded through a combination of the General Fund, regulatory fees, and bond funds. State funding for wildlife conservation program operations is around $100 million per year.

407,California,2010,Imposes New Two-Thirds Voter Approval Requirement for Local Public Electricity Providers. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"June 8, 2010 primary ballot<BR>  Requires two-thirds voter approval before local governments provide electricity service to new customers or establish a community choice electricity program using public funds or bonds.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B>  Californians generally receive their electricity service from one of three types of providers: investor-owned utilities (IOUs), local publicly owned electric utilities, or electric service providers (ESPs). These provide 68 percent, 24 percent, and 8 percent, respectively, of retail electricity service in the state.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Community Choice Aggregation.</I> In addition to the ESP arrangements discussed above, state law allows a city or a county, or a combination of the two, to arrange to provide electricity within their jurisdiction through a contract with an electricity provider other than the IOU that would otherwise serve that local area. This is referred to as ""community choice aggregation."" Although only one community choice aggregator (CCA) currently exists to provide electricity in California, several communities are exploring this option. A CCA could get its electricity from an ESP, using the transmission and distribution system of the IOU serving that local area. Electricity customers within that area would automatically get their electricity from the CCA unless they elected to continue to receive service from the IOU.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Proposals to Create and Expand Public Electricity Providers.</I> In recent years, a limited number of local governments in the state have explored the idea of creating new public providers of electricity or expanding publicly owned utilities into new territory currently served by an IOU. For example, the City and County of San Francisco has considered creating a CCA that would include territory currently served by PG&E. As another example, Yolo County explored having SMUD provide electricity service to territory within the county currently served by PG&E. In some cases, these proposals have been put before the voters for their approval, under provisions of state law discussed below.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Voter Approval Requirements for Publicly Owned Electricity Providers.</I> As noted above, publicly owned utilities can be organized under several different types of government structures. Each type of local government entity that is authorized to provide electricity service, and that is considering either the start-up of electricity service or the expansion of existing service beyond its current service area, is subject to certain state requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Various statutes specify whether voter approval is required for the start-up of electricity service by authorized local government entities. Under state law, if a local government intends to expand its electricity service into a new territory, that new area must be annexed and, in certain cases, a majority of the voters in the area proposed for annexation must approve the expansion. In such cases, however, no vote of the public is generally required within the existing service territory of the local governmental entity that is proposing the expansion. (In some cases, a local commission requires such a vote as a condition of approving the annexation.) In contrast, local agency action to create and begin implementation of a CCA may be undertaken upon a vote of the local agency governing board and does not require local voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposal</B><BR>  The measure places new voter approval requirements on local governments before they can use ""public funds""—defined broadly in the measure to include tax revenues, various forms of debt, and ratepayer funds-—to start up electricity service, expand electricity service into a new territory, or implement a CCA.<BR>  - First, before an authorized local government entity can start up electricity service, it must receive approval by two-thirds of the voters in the area proposed to be served.<BR>  - Second, before an existing publicly owned utility can expand its electric delivery service into a new territory, it must receive approval by two-thirds of the voters in the area currently served by the utility and two-thirds of the voters in the new area proposed to be served.<BR>  - Third, the measure requires two-thirds voter approval for a local government to implement a CCA.   The measure provides three exemptions to local governments from these voter approval requirements:<BR>  <BR>  - If the use of public funds has been previously approved by the voters both within the existing local jurisdiction and the territory proposed for expansion.<BR>  - If the public funds would be used solely to purchase, provide, or supply specified types of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind or solar power.<BR>  - If the public funds would be used only to provide electric delivery service for the local government's own use.",Proposition 16,Initiative,Elections,Primary,0.47200000000000003,Amendment,0
408,California,2010,Limits on Property Tax Assessment. Seismic Retrofitting of Existing Buildings. Legislative Constitutional Amendment.,"Scheduled for the June 8, 2010 primary<BR>  - Provides that construction to seismically retrofit existing buildings will not trigger reassessment of property tax value, regardless of the type of building.<BR>  - Sets a statewide standard for the types of seismic retrofit improvements exempt from reassessment.<BR>  - Limits the exemption from reassessment to specific components of construction or reconstruction that qualify as seismic retrofit improvements, as defined by the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Background</B><BR>  Local property taxes are based on each property's assessed value. When a property is purchased, it is generally given an assessed value equal to its purchase price. As long as a property has the same owner and there is no new construction on the property, its assessed value generally remains the same, except for a small annual increase for inflation. New construction generally causes a reassessment if it adds a building, adds space, converts a building to a new use, or renovates the building to make it like new. The property's assessed value is increased to reflect the value added by the new construction. In contrast, the assessed value is not increased for normal maintenance and repair, such as replacing a leaky roof.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, there are several specific exclusions in the State Constitution from the new construction rule. Among them are two separate provisions regarding earthquake safety modifications on existing buildings. The first one excludes earthquake safety upgrades on ""unreinforced masonry buildings"" (such as those made of brick or cement blocks) that are required by local ordinances. Such upgrades are excluded from reassessments for a period of 15 years. The second excludes from reassessment other earthquake safety modifications to any type of building and has no time limit. Both exclusions apply only until the property is sold.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposal</B><BR>  This constitutional amendment deletes both of the existing exclusions and replaces them with a single exclusion for all earthquake safety upgrades. The exclusion would not be time-limited and would last until the property is sold. This amendment has the practical effect of removing the 15-year limit to the exclusion for safety upgrades on unreinforced masonry buildings.",Proposition 13,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,Primary,0.85,Amendment,1
409,California,2010,Prohibits the State from Taking Funds Used for Transportation or Local Government Projects and Services. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure reduces or eliminates the state's authority to:<BR>  - Use state fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on state transportation bonds.<BR>  - Borrow or change the distribution of state fuel tax revenues.<BR>  - Redirect redevlopment agency property taxes to any other local government.<BR>  - Temporarily shift property taxes from cities, counties, and special districts to schools.<BR>  - Use vehicle license fee (VLF) revenues to reimburse local governments for state mandated costs.<BR>  <BR>  As a result, this measure affects resources in the state's General Fund and transportation funds. The General Fund is the state's main funding source for schools, universities, prisons, health, and social services programs. Transportation funds are placed in seperate accounts and used to pay for state and local transportations programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Use of Funds to Pay for Transportation Bonds  State Fuel Taxes.</B></I>The state annually collects about $5.9 billion in fuel tax revenues for transportation purposes—with most of this amount coming from a 35.3 cents per gallon excise tax on gasoline. Prior to changes made in early 2010, the state charged two taxes on gasoline: an 18 cents per gallon excise tax and a sales tax based on the costs of the purchase. Under the changes, the state collects the same amount of total revenues but does not charge a state sales tax on gasoline. (These state fuel tax changes did not affect the local sales tax on gasoline.) Part of the reason the state made these changes is because revenues from the gasoline excise tax can be used more flexibly than sales tax revenues to pay debt service on transportation bonds.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Current Use of Fuel Tax Revenues.</B></I> The main uses of state fuel tax revenues are (1) constructing and maintaining highways, streets, and roads and (2) funding transit and intercity rail services. In addition, the state uses some of its fuel tax revenues to pay debt–service costs on voter–approved transportation bonds. In the current year, for example, the state will use about $850 million of fuel tax revenues to pay debt-service costs on bonds issued to fund highway, road, and transit projects. In future years, this amount is expected to increase to about $1 billion annually.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Reduces State Authority.</B></I> The measure reduces state authority to use fuel tax revenues to pay for bonds. Under the measure, the state could not use fuel tax revenues to pay for any bonds that have already been issued. In addition, the state's authority to use fuel tax revenues to pay for bonds that have not yet been issued would be significantly restricted.<BR>  <BR>  Because of these restrictions, the state would need to pay about $1 billion of annual bond costs from its General Fund rather than from transportation accounts. (In the current year, the amount would be somewhat less because the state would have paid some of its bond costs using fuel tax revenues by the time of the election.) This, in turn, would (1) increase the amount of funds the state would have available to spend for transportation programs and (2) reduce the amount of General Fund resources the state would have available to spend on non-transportation programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Borrowing of Fuel Tax Revenues</B><BR>  <B><I>Current Authority to Borrow.</B></I> While state fuel tax revenues generally must be used for transportation purposes, the state may use these funds for other purposes under certain circumstances. Specifically:<BR>  <BR>  -- <B><I>Borrowing for Cash Flow Purposes.</B></I> The state historically has paid out most of its General Fund expenses between July and December of each year, but received most of its revenues between January and June. To help manage this uneven cash flow, the state often borrows funds from various state accounts, including fuel tax funds, on a temporary basis. The cash flow loans of fuel tax funds often total $1 billion or more.<BR>  -- <B><I>Borrowing for Budget-Balancing Purposes.</B></I> In cases of severe state fiscal hardship, the state may use fuel tax revenues to help address a budgetary problem. The state must pay these funds back within three years. For example, at the time this analysis was prepared, the proposed 2010–11 state budget included a $650 million loan of state fuel tax revenues to the state General Fund.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Prohibits Borrowing.</B></I> This measure generally prohibits fuel tax revenues from being loaned—either for cash flow or budget–balancing purposes—to the General Fund or to any other state fund. The state, therefore, would have to take alternative actions to address its short-term borrowing needs. These actions could include borrowing more from private markets, slowing state expenditures to accumulate larger reserves in its accounts, or speeding up the collection of tax revenues. In place of budgetary borrowing, the state would have to take alternative actions to balance future General Fund budgets—such as reducing state spending or increasing state taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Distribution of Fuel Tax Revenues</B><BR>  <B><I>Current Distribution.</B></I> Roughly two–thirds of the state's fuel tax revenues are spent by the state, and the rest is given to cities, counties, and transit districts. Although state law specifies how much money local agencies shall receive, the Legislature may pass a law with a majority vote of each house to change these funding distributions. For example, the state has made various changes to the allocation of transit funding over recent years.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Limits Changes to Distribution.</B></I> This measure constrains the state's authority to change the distribution of state fuel tax revenues to local agencies. In the case of fuel excise taxes, the measure requires that the formula to distribute these tax revenues to local governments for the construction or maintenance of local streets and roads be the one that was in effect on June 30, 2009. (At that time, local governments received the revenues generated from 6 cents of the 18 cents being collected from the fuel excise tax.) Under this measure, the state could enact a law to change this allocation, but only by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature and after the California Transportation Commission conducted a series of public hearings.<BR>  <BR>  In the case of diesel sales tax revenues (used primarily for transit and transportation planning), current law requires that the funds be distributed 25 percent to the state and 75 percent to local governments, beginning in 2011–12. The measure specifies that the funds instead be split equally between local and state programs. This change in diesel sales tax revenue distribution, therefore, would provide somewhat lower ongoing funding for local transit purposes and more funding for state transit purposes than otherwise would be the case. Under the measure, the state could not change this distribution of funds.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Allocation of Property Tax Revenues</B><BR>  <B><I>Current Property Tax Distribution.</B></I> California property owners pay a 1 percent tax on the value of their homes and other properties, plus any additional property tax rates for voter–approved debt. State law specifies how county auditors are to distribute these revenues among local governments. State law allows the state to make some changes to the distribution of property tax revenues. For example, the state may require redevelopment agencies to shift revenues to nearby schools. Recently, the state required redevelopment agencies to shift $2 billion of revenues to schools over two years. (This amount is roughly 15 percent of total redevelopment revenues.) In addition, during times of severe state fiscal hardship, the state may require that a portion of property tax revenues be temporarily shifted away from cities, counties, and special districts. In this case, however, the state must repay the local agencies for their losses within three years, including interest. Recently, the state required these agencies to shift $1.9 billion of funds to schools. The major reason the state made these revenue shifts was to reduce state General Fund costs for education and other programs.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Reduces State Authority.</B></I> This measure prohibits the state from enacting new laws that require redevelopment agencies to shift funds to schools or other agencies. The measure also eliminates the state's authority to shift property taxes temporarily during a severe state fiscal hardship. Under the measure, therefore, the state would have to take other actions to balance its budget in some years—such as reducing state spending or increasing state taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Use of VLF Revenues</B><BR>  <B><I>Current VLF.</B></I> California vehicle owners pay a VLF based on their vehicle's value at a rate of 1.15 percent, including a 0.65 percent ongoing rate and a 0.50 percent temporary rate. Most VLF revenues are distributed to local governments.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Current Mandate Payments.</B></I> The state generally must reimburse local governments when it ""mandates"" that they provide a new program or higher level of service. The state usually provides reimbursements through appropriations in the annual budget act or by providing other offsetting funds.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Restricts Use of VLF Funds.</B></I> This measure specifies that the state may not reimburse local governments for a mandate by giving them an increased share of VLF revenues collected under the ongoing rate. Under the measure, therefore, the state would have to reimburse local governments using other resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Laws That Are in Conflict With This Proposition</B><BR>  <B><I>Voids Recent Laws.</B></I> Any law enacted between October 20, 2009, and November 2, 2010, that is in conflict with this proposition would be repealed. Several factors make it difficult to determine the practical effect of this provision. First, parts of this measure would be subject to future interpretation by the courts. Second, in the spring of 2010, the state made significant changes to its fuel tax laws, and the full effect of this measure on these changes is not certain. Finally, at the time this analysis was prepared (early in the summer of 2010), the state was considering many new laws and funding changes to address its major budget difficulties. As a result, it is not possible to determine the full range of state laws that could be affected or repealed by this measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Requires Reimbursement for Future Laws.</B></I> Under this measure, if a court ruled that the state violated a provision of Proposition 22, the State Controller would reimburse the affected local governments or accounts within 30 days. Funds for these reimbursements, including interest, would be taken from the state General Fund and would not require legislative approval.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  Under the State Constitution, state and local government funding and responsibilities are interrelated. Both levels of government share revenues raised by some taxes—such as sales taxes and fuel taxes. Both levels also share the costs for some programs—such as many health and social services programs. While the state does not receive and property tax revenues, it has authority over the distribution of these revenues among local agencies and schools.<BR>  <BR>  Over the years, the state has made decisions that have affected local governent revenues and costs in various ways. Some of these decisions have benefited the state fiscally, and others have benefited local governments. For example, in the early 1990s, the state permanently shifted a share of city, county, and special district property tax revenues to schools. These shifts had the effect of reducing local agency resources and reducing state costs for education. Conversely, in the late 1990s, the state changed laws regarding trial court program funding. This change had the effect of shifting local agency costs to the state.<BR>  <BR>  In recent years, the state's voters have amended the Constitution to limit the state's authority over local finances. Under Proposition 1A of 2004, the state no longer has the authority to permanently shift city, county, and special district property tax revenues to schools, or take certain other actions that affect local governments. In addition, Proposition 1A of 2006 restricts the state's ability to borrow state gasoline sales tax revenues. These provisions in the Constitution, however, do not eliminate state authority to temporarily borrow or redirect some city, county, and special district funds. In addition, these propositions do not eliminate the state's authority to redirect local redevelopment agency revenues. (Redevelopment agencies work on projects to improve blighted urban areas.)",Proposition 22,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.607,Amendment,1
410,California,2010,Redistricting of Congressional Districts. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  <B><I>Proposed New Method for Congressional Redistricting.</B></I> This measure amends the Constitution to change the redistricting process for California's districts in the U.S. House of Representatives. Specifically, the measure removes the authority for congressional redistricting from the Legislature and instead gives this authority to the Citizens Redistricting Commission. The commission would draw congressional districts essentially as it draws other district lines under Proposition 11. The commission, for example, could not draw congressional districts in order to favor incumbents, political candidates, or political parties. The commission also is to consider the geographic integrity of cities, counties, neighborhoods, and communities of interest. As under Proposition 11, compliance with federal law would be required.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>""Community of Interest"" Defined.</B></I> In addition to adding similar criteria for congressional redistricting as those established in Proposition 11, the measure defines a ""community of interest"" for both congressional redistricting and redistricting of State Assembly, State Senate, and BOE seats. A community of interest is defined as ""a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation.""<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Two Redistricting–Related Measures on This Ballot.</B></I> In addition to this measure, another measure on the November 2010 ballot—Proposition 27—concerns redistricting issues. If both of these measures are approved by voters, the proposition receiving the greater number of ""yes"" votes would be the only one to go into effect.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  In a process known as ""redistricting,"" the State Constitution requires that the state adjust the boundary lines of districts once every ten years following the federal census for the State Assembly, State Senate, State Board of Equalization (BOE), and California's congressional districts for the U.S. House of Representatives. To comply with federal law, redistricting must establish districts which are roughly equal in population.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Recent Changes to State Legislature and BOE Redistricting.</B></I> In the past, district boundaries for all of the offices listed above were determined in bills that became law after they were approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. On some occasions, when the Legislature and the Governor were unable to agree on redistricting plans, the California Supreme Court performed the redistricting.<BR>  <BR>  In November 2008, voters passed Proposition 11, which created the Citizens Redistricting Commission to establish new district boundaries for the State Assembly, State Senate, and BOE beginning after the 2010 census. To be established once every ten years, the commission will consist of 14 registered voters—5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 4 others—who apply for the position and are chosen according to specified rules.<BR>  <BR>  When the commission sets district boundaries, it must meet the requirements of federal law and other requirements, such as not favoring or discriminating against political parties, incumbents, or political candidates. In addition, the commission is required, to the extent possible, to adopt district boundaries that:<BR>  - Maintain the geographic integrity of any city, county, neighborhood, and ""community of interest"" in a single district. (The commission is responsible for defining ""communities of interest"" for its redistricting activities.)<BR>  - Develop geographically compact districts.<BR>  - Place two Assembly districts together within one Senate district and place ten Senate districts together within one BOE district.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Current Congressional Redistricting Process.</B></I> Currently, California is entitled to 53 of the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Proposition 11 did not change the redistricting process for these 53 congressional seats. Currently, therefore, redistricting plans for congressional seats are included in bills that are approved by the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 11, however, did make some changes to the requirements that the Legislature must meet in drawing congressional districts. The Legislature—like the commission—now must attempt to draw geographically compact districts and maintain geographic integrity of localities, neighborhoods, and communities of interest, as defined by the Legislature. Proposition 11, however, does not prohibit the Legislature from favoring or discriminating against political parties, incumbents, or political candidates when drawing congressional districts.",Proposition 20,Initiative,Redistricting,General,0.613,Amendment,1

412,California,2010,Requires that Certain State and Local Fees Be Approved by Two-Thirds Vote.  Fees Include Those that Address Adverse Impacts on Society or the Environment Caused by Fee-Payer's Business.  Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This measure expands the definition of a tax and a tax increase so that more proposals would require approval by two–thirds of the Legislature or by local voters:<BR>  <BR>  - <B>Expands the Scope of What Is a State or Local Tax</B><BR>  -- Classifies as taxes some fees and charges that government currently may impose with a majority vote.<BR>  -- As a result, more state revenue proposals would require approval by two–thirds of each house of the Legislature and more local revenue proposals would require local voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  - <B>Raises the Approval Requirement for Some State Revenue Proposals</B><BR>  -- Requires a two–thirds vote of each house of the Legislature to approve laws that increase taxes on any taxpayer, even if the law's overall fiscal effect does not increase state revenues.<BR>  <BR>  - <B>Repeals Recently Passed, Conflicting State Laws</B><BR>  -- Repeals recent state laws that conflict with this measure, unless they are approved again by two–thirds of each house of the Legislature. Repeal becomes effective in November 2011.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Definition of a State or Local Tax</B><BR>  <B><I>Expands Definition.</B></I> This measure broadens the definition of a state or local tax to include many payments currently considered to be fees or charges. As a result, the measure would have the effect of increasing the number of revenue proposals subject to higher approval requirements. Generally, the types of fees and charges that would become taxes under the measure are ones that government imposes to address health, environmental, or other societal or economic concerns. This is because these fees pay for many services that benefit the public broadly, rather than providing services directly to the fee payer. The state currently uses these types of regulatory fees to pay for most of its environmental programs.<BR>  <BR>  Certain other fees and charges also could be considered to be taxes under the measure. For example, some business assessments could be considered to be taxes because government uses the assessment revenues to improve shopping districts (such as providing parking, street lighting, increased security, and marketing), rather than providing a direct and distinct service to the business owner.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Some Fees and Charges Are Not Affected.</B></I> The change in the definition of taxes would not affect most user fees, property development charges, and property assessments. This is because these fees and charges generally comply with Proposition 26's requirements already, or are exempt from its provisions. In addition, most other fees or charges in existence at the time of the November 2, 2010 election would not be affected unless:<BR>  <BR>  - The state or local government later increases or extends the fees or charges. (In this case, the state or local government would have to comply with the approval requirements of Proposition 26.)<BR>  - The fees or charges were created or increased by a state law—passed between January 1, 2010 and November 2, 2010—that conflicts with Proposition 26 (discussed further below).<BR>  <BR>  <B>Approval Requirement for State Tax Measures</B><BR>  <B><I>Current Requirement.</B></I> The State Constitution currently specifies that laws enacted ""for the purpose of increasing revenues"" must be approved by two–thirds of each house of the Legislature. Under current practice, a law that increases the amount of taxes charged to some taxpayers but offers an equal (or larger) reduction in taxes for other taxpayers has been viewed as not increasing revenues. As such, it can be approved by a majority vote of the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>New Approval Requirement.</B></I> The measure specifies that state laws that result in any taxpayer paying a higher tax must be approved by two-thirds of each house of the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Laws in Conflict With Proposition 26</B><BR>  <B><I>Repeal Requirement.</B></I> Any state law adopted between January 1, 2010 and November 2, 2010 that conflicts with Proposition 26 would be repealed one year after the proposition is approved. This repeal would not take place, however, if two-thirds of each house of the Legislature passed the law again.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Recent Fuel Tax Law Changes.</B></I> In the spring of 2010, the state increased fuel taxes paid by gasoline suppliers, but decreased other fuel taxes paid by gasoline retailers. Overall, these changes do not raise more state tax revenues, but they give the state greater spending flexibility over their use.<BR>  <BR>  Using this flexibility, the state shifted about $1 billion of annual transportation bond costs from the state's General Fund to its fuel tax funds. (The General Fund is the state's main funding source for schools, universities, prisons, health, and social services programs.) This action decreases the amount of money available for transportation programs, but helps the state balance its General Fund budget. Because the Legislature approved this tax change with a majority vote in each house, this law would be repealed in November 2011—unless the Legislature approved the tax again with a two–thirds vote in each house.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other Laws.</B></I> At the time this analysis was prepared (early in the summer of 2010), the Legislature and Governor were considering many new laws and funding changes to address the state's major budget difficulties. In addition, parts of this measure would be subject to future interpretation by the courts. As a result, we cannot determine the full range of state laws that could be affected or repealed by the measure.",Proposition 26,Initiative,Elections,General,0.525,Amendment,1
413,California,2010,"Suspends Implementation of Air Pollution Control Law (AB 32) Requiring Major Sources of Emissions to Report and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions That Cause Global Warming, Until Unemployment Drops to 5.5 Percent or Less for Full Year.","<B>PROPOSAL</B><BR>  This proposition suspends the implementation of AB 32 until the unemployment rate in California is 5.5 percent or less for four consecutive quarters. During the suspension period, state agencies are prohibited from proposing or adopting new regulations, or enforcing previously adopted regulations, that would implement AB 32. (Once AB 32 went back into effect, this measure could not suspend it again.)<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>AB 32 Would Be Suspended, Likely for Many Years.</B></I> Under this proposition, AB 32 would be suspended immediately. It would remain suspended until the state's unemployment rate was 5.5 percent or less for four consecutive quarters (a one-year period). We cannot estimate when the suspension of AB 32 might end. Since 1970, the state has had three periods (each about ten quarters long) when the unemployment rate was at or below 5.5 percent for four consecutive quarters or more. The unemployment rate in California for the first two quarters of 2010 was above 12 percent. Economic forecasts for the next five years have the state's unemployment rate remaining above 8 percent. Given these factors, it appears likely that AB 32 would remain suspended for many years.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Various Climate Change Regulatory Activities Would Be Suspended.</B></I> This proposition would result in the suspension of a number of measures in the Scoping Plan for which regulations either have been adopted or are proposed for adoption. Specifically, this proposition would likely suspend:<BR>  -- The proposed cap–and–trade regulation discussed below.<BR>  -- The ""low carbon fuel standard"" regulation that requires providers of transportation fuel in California (such as refiners and importers) to change the mix of fuels to lower GHG emissions.<BR>  -- The proposed ARB regulation that is intended to require privately and publicly owned utilities and others who sell electricity to obtain at least 33 percent of their supply from ""renewable"" sources, such as solar or wind power, by 2020. (The current requirement that 20 percent of the electricity obtained by privately owned utilities come from renewable sources by 2010 would not be suspended by this proposition.)<BR>  -- The fee to recover state agency costs of administering AB 32.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Much Regulation in the Scoping Plan Would Likely Continue.</B></I> Many current activities related to addressing climate change and reducing GHG emissions would probably not be suspended by this proposition. That is because certain Scoping Plan regulations implement laws other than AB 32. The regulations that would likely move forward, for example, include:<BR>  -- New vehicle emission standards for cars and smaller trucks. <BR>  -- A program to encourage homeowners to install solar panels on their roofs.<BR>  -- Land–use policies to promote less reliance on vehicle use.<BR>  -- Building and appliance energy efficiency requirements.<BR>  <BR>  We estimate that more than one–half of the emission reductions from implementing the Scoping Plan would come because of laws enacted separately from AB 32.<BR>  <BR>  <B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>  <B><I>Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases.</B></I> Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are gases that trap heat from the sun within the earth's atmosphere, thereby warming the earth's temperature. Both natural phenomena (mainly the evaporation of water) and human activities (principally burning fossil fuels) produce GHGs. Scientific experts have voiced concerns that higher concentrations of GHGs resulting from human activities are increasing global temperatures, and that such global temperature rises could eventually cause significant problems. Such global temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming, or climate change.<BR>  <BR>  As a populous state with a large industrial economy, California is the second largest emitter of GHGs in the United States and one of the largest emitters of GHGs in the world. Climate change is a global issue necessitating an international approach. Actions in California regarding GHGs have been advocated on the basis that they will contribute to a solution and may act as a catalyst to the undertaking of GHG mitigation policies elsewhere in our nation and in other countries.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Assembly Bill 32 Enacted to Limit GHGs.</B></I> In 2006, the state enacted the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, commonly referred to as Assembly Bill 32 or ""AB 32."" This legislation established the target of reducing the state's emissions of GHGs by 2020 to the level that emissions were at in 1990. It is estimated that achieving this target would result in about a 30 percent reduction in GHGs in 2020 from where their level would otherwise be in the absence of AB 32.<BR>  <BR>  Assembly Bill 32 requires the state Air Resources Board (ARB) to adopt rules and regulations to achieve this reduction. The law also directs ARB, in developing these rules and regulations, to take advantage of opportunities to improve air quality, thereby creating public health benefits from the state's GHG emission reduction activities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other Laws Would Reduce GHG Emissions.</B></I> In addition to AB 32, a number of other state laws have been enacted by the Legislature that would reduce GHG emissions. In some cases, the main purpose of these other laws is specifically to reduce GHG emissions. For example, a 2002 law requires the ARB to adopt regulations to reduce GHG emissions from cars and smaller trucks. Other laws have authorized various energy efficiency programs that could have the effect of reducing GHG emissions, although this may not have been their principal purpose.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>""Scoping Plan"" to Reach GHG Emission Reduction Target.</B></I> As required by AB 32, the ARB in December 2008 released its plan on how AB 32's GHG emission reduction target for 2020 would be met. The plan—referred to as the AB 32 Scoping Plan—encompasses a number of different types of measures to reduce GHG emissions. Some are measures authorized by AB 32, while others are authorized by separately enacted laws. Some of these measures have as their primary objective something other than reducing GHGs, such as reducing the state's dependency on fossil fuels.<BR>  <BR>  The plan includes a mix of traditional regulatory measures and market–based measures. Traditional regulations, such as energy efficiency standards for buildings, would require individuals and businesses to take specific actions to reduce emissions. Market–based measures provide those subject to them greater flexibility in how to achieve GHG emission reductions. The major market–based measure included in the Scoping Plan is a ""cap–and–trade"" program. Under such a program, the ARB would set a limit, or cap, on GHG emissions; issue a limited number of emission allowances to emitters related to the amount of GHGs they emit; and allow emitters covered by the program to buy, sell, or trade those emission allowances.<BR>  <BR>  Some measures in the Scoping Plan have already been adopted in the form of regulations. Other regulations are either currently under development or will be developed in the near future. Assembly Bill 32 requires that all regulations for GHG emission reduction measures be adopted by January 1, 2011, and in effect by January 1, 2012.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Fee Assessed to Cover State's Administrative Costs.</B></I> As allowed under AB 32, the ARB has adopted a regulation to recover the state's costs of administering the GHG emission reduction programs. Beginning in fall 2010, entities that emit a high amount of GHGs, such as power plants and refineries, must pay annual fees that will be used to offset these administrative costs. Fee revenues will also be used to repay various state special funds that have made loans totaling $83 million to the AB 32 program. These loans have staggered repayment dates that run through 2014.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>The Economic Impact of Implementing the Scoping Plan.</B></I> The implementation of the AB 32 Scoping Plan will reduce levels of GHG emissions and related air pollutants by imposing various new requirements and costs on certain businesses and individuals. The reduced emissions and the new costs will both affect the California economy. There is currently a significant ongoing debate about the impacts to the California economy from implementing the Scoping Plan. Economists, environmentalists, and policy makers have voiced differing views about how the Scoping Plan will affect the gross state product, personal income, prices, and jobs. The considerable uncertainty about the Scoping Plan's ""bottom–line"" or net impact on the economy is due to a number of reasons. First, because a number of the Scoping Plan measures have yet to be fully developed, the economic impacts will depend heavily on how the measures are designed in the public regulatory process. Second, because a number of the Scoping Plan measures are phased in over time, the full economic impacts of some measures would not be felt for several years. Third, the implementation of the Scoping Plan has the potential to create both positive and negative impacts on the economy. This includes the fact that there will be both ""winners"" and ""losers"" under the implementation of the Scoping Plan for particular economic sectors, businesses, and individuals.<BR>  <BR>  A number of studies have considered the economic impacts of the Scoping Plan implementation in 2020—the year when AB 32's GHG emission reduction target is to be met. Those studies that have looked at the economic impacts from a relatively broad perspective have, for the most part, found that there will be some modest reduction in California's gross state product, a comprehensive measure of economic activity for the state. These findings reflect how such things as more expensive energy, new investment requirements, and costs of regulatory compliance combine to increase the costs of producing materials, goods, and services that consumers and businesses buy. Given all of the uncertainties involved, however, the net economic impact of the Scoping Plan remains a matter of debate.",Proposition 23,Initiative,Energy & Electric Utilities,General,0.384,Statutory,0

423,California,2012,Tax for Education and Early Childhood Programs. Initiative Statute.,"<B>Summary</B><BR>  Increases taxes on earnings using sliding scale, for twelve years. Revenues go to K–12 schools and early childhood programs, and for four years to repaying state debt. Fiscal Impact: Increased state tax revenues for 12 years—roughly $10 billion annually in initial years, tending to grow over time. Funds used for schools, child care, and preschool, as well as providing savings on state debt payments.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Analysis</B><BR>  This measure raises personal income taxes on most California taxpayers from 2013 through 2024. The revenues raised by this tax increase would be spent on public schools, child care and preschool programs, and state debt payments. Each of the measure’s key provisions is discussed in more detail below.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increases PIT Rates.</B></I> This measure increases state PIT rates on all but the lowest income bracket, effective over the 12-year period from 2013 through 2024. The additional marginal tax rates would increase with each higher tax bracket. For example, for joint filers, an additional 0.7 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $34,692 and $54,754, increasing the total rate to 4.7 percent. Similarly, an additional 1.1 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $54,754 and $76,008, increasing the total rate to 7.1 percent. These higher tax rates would result in higher tax liabilities on roughly 60 percent of state PIT returns. (Personal, dependent, senior, and other tax credits, among other factors, would continue to eliminate all tax liabilities for many lower-income tax filers even if they have income in a bracket affected by the measure’s rate increases.) The additional 1 percent rate for mental health services would still apply to income in excess of $1 million. This measure's rate changes, therefore, would increase these taxpayers' marginal PIT rates from 10.3 percent to as much as 12.5 percent. Proposition 30 on this ballot also would increase PIT rates.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Provides Funds for Public Schools, Early Care and Education (ECE), and Debt Service.</B></I> The revenues raised by the measure would be deposited into a newly created California Education Trust Fund (CETF). These funds would be dedicated exclusively to three purposes. In 2013–14 and 2014–15, the measure allocates 60 percent of CETF funds to schools, 10 percent of funds to ECE programs, and 30 percent of funds to make state debt payments. In 2015–16 and 2016–17, the same general allocations are authorized but a somewhat higher share could be used for state debt payments. This is because beginning in 2015–16, the measure: (1) limits the growth in total allocations to schools and ECE programs based on the average growth in California per capita personal income over the previous five years and (2) dedicates the funds collected above the growth rate to state debt payments. From 2017–18 through 2023–24, up to 85 percent of CETF funds would go to schools and up to 15 percent would go to ECE programs, with revenues in excess of the growth rate continuing to be used for state debt payments.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Cannot Be Amended by the Legislature.</B></I> If adopted by voters, this measure could be amended only by a future ballot measure. The Legislature would be prohibited from making any modifications to the measure without voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  Under this measure, schools will receive roughly 60 percent of the revenues raised by the PIT rate increases through 2016–17 and roughly 85 percent annually thereafter. These CETF funds would be in addition to Proposition 98 General Fund support for schools. The funds support three grant programs. The measure also creates spending restrictions and reporting requirements related to these funds. These major provisions are discussed in more detail below.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Distributes School Funds Through Three Grant Programs.</B>  Proposition 38 requires that CETF school funds be allocated as follows:<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Educational Program Grants (70 Percent of Funds)</B></I> . The largest share of funds—70 percent of all CETF school funding—would be distributed based on the number of students at each school. The specific per-student grant, however, would depend on the grade of each student, with schools receiving more funds for students in higher grades. Educational program grants could be spent on a broad range of activities, including instruction, school support staff (such as counselors and librarians), and parent engagement.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Low-Income Student Grants (18 Percent of Funds).</B></I>  The measure requires that 18 percent of CETF school funds be allocated at one statewide rate based on the number of low-income students (defined as the number of students eligible for free school meals) enrolled in each school. As with the educational program grants, low-income student grants could be spent on a broad range of educational activities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Training, Technology, and Teaching Materials Grants (12 Percent of Funds).</B></I>  The remaining 12 percent of funds would be allocated at one statewide rate based on the number of students at each school. The funds could be used only for training school staff and purchasing up-to-date technology and teaching materials.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Requires Funds Be Spent at Corresponding School Sites.</B></I>  Funds received by school districts from this measure must be spent at the specific school whose students generated the funds. In the case of low-income student grants, for example, if 100 percent of low-income students in a school district were located in one particular school, all low-income grant funds would need to be spent at that specific school. As with most other school funding, however, the local governing board would determine how CETF funds are spent at each school site. To ensure that Proposition 38 funds would result in a net increase in funding for all schools, the measure also would require school districts to make reasonable efforts to avoid reducing per-student funding from non-CETF sources at each school site below 2012–13 levels. If a school district reduces the per-student funding for any school site below the 2012–13 level, it must explain the reasons for the reduction in a public meeting held at or near the school.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Requires School Districts to Seek Public Input Prior to Making Spending Decisions.</B></I>  Proposition 38 also requires school district governing boards at an open public hearing to seek input from students, parents, teachers, administrators, and other school staff on how to spend CETF school funds. When the governing board decides how to spend the funds, it must explain—publicly and online—how CETF school expenditures will improve educational outcomes and how those improved outcomes will be measured.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Creates Budget Reporting Requirements for Each School.</B></I>  The measure also includes several reporting requirements for school districts. Most notably, beginning in 2012–13, the measure requires all school districts to create and publish an online budget for each of their schools. The budget must show funding and expenditures at each school from all funding sources, broken down by various spending categories. The state Superintendent of Public Instruction must provide a uniform format for budgets to be reported and must make all school budgets available to the public, including data from previous years. In addition, school districts must provide a report on how CETF funds were spent at each of their schools within 60 days after the close of the school year.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other Allowances and Prohibitions.</B></I>  The measure allows up to 1 percent of a school district’s allocation to be spent on budgeting, reporting, and audit requirements. The measure prohibits CETF school funds from being used to provide salary or benefit increases unless the increases are provided to other like employees that are funded with non-CETF dollars. The measure also has a provision that prohibits CETF school monies from being used to replace state, local, or federal funding provided as of November 1, 2012.",Proposition 38,Initiative,Education: PreK-12,General,0.27699999999999997,Statutory,0
424,California,2012,Tax Treatment for Multistate Businesses. Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency Funding. Initiative Statute.,"<B>Summary</B><BR>  Requires multistate businesses to pay income taxes based on percentage of their sales in California. Dedicates revenues for five years to clean/efficient energy projects. Fiscal Impact: Increased state revenues of $1 billion annually, with half of the revenues over the next five years spent on energy efficiency projects. Of the remaining revenues, a significant portion likely would be spent on schools.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Analysis</B><BR>  <B><I>Eliminates Ability of Multistate Businesses to Choose How Taxable Income Is Determined.</B></I> Under this measure, starting in 2013, multistate businesses would no longer be allowed to choose the method for determining their state taxable income that is most advantageous for them. Instead, most multistate businesses would have to determine their California taxable income using the single sales factor method. Businesses that operate only in California would be unaffected by this measure.<BR>  <BR>  This measure also includes rules regarding how all multistate businesses calculate the portion of some sales that are allocated to California for state tax purposes. These include a set of specific rules for certain large cable companies.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Provides Funding for Energy Efficiency and Alternative Energy Projects.</B></I> This measure establishes a new state fund, the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund, to support projects intended to improve energy efficiency and expand the use of alternative energy. The measure states that the fund could be used to support: (1) energy efficiency retrofits and alternative energy projects in public schools, colleges, universities, and other public facilities; (2) financial and technical assistance for energy retrofits; and (3) job training and workforce development programs related to energy efficiency and alternative energy. The Legislature would determine spending from the fund and be required to use the monies for cost-effective projects run by agencies with expertise in managing energy projects. The measure also (1) specifies that all funded projects must be coordinated with CEC and CPUC and (2) creates a new nine-member oversight board to annually review and evaluate spending from the fund.<BR>  <BR>  The Clean Energy Job Creation Fund would be supported by some of the new revenue raised by moving to a mandatory single sales factor. Specifically, half of the revenues so raised—up to a maximum of $550 million—would be transferred annually to the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund. These transfers would occur for only five fiscal years—2013–14 through 2017–18.",Proposition 39,Initiative,Business & Commerce,General,0.604,Statutory,1
425,California,2012,Temporary Taxes to Fund Education. Guaranteed Local Public Safety Funding. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.,"<B>Summary</B><BR>  Increases taxes on earnings over $250,000 for seven years and sales taxes by ¼ cent for four years, to fund schools. Guarantees public safety realignment funding. Fiscal Impact: Increased state tax revenues through 2018–19, averaging about $6 billion annually over the next few years. Revenues available for funding state budget. In 2012–13, planned spending reductions, primarily to education programs, would not occur.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Analysis</B><BR>  This measure temporarily increases the state sales tax rate for all taxpayers and the personal income tax (PIT) rates for upper-income taxpayers. These temporary tax increases provide additional revenues to pay for programs funded in the state budget. The state’s 2012–13 budget plan—approved by the Legislature and the Governor in June 2012—assumes passage of this measure. The budget, however, also includes a backup plan that requires spending reductions (known as “trigger cuts”) in the event that voters reject this measure. This measure also places into the State Constitution certain requirements related to the recent transfer of some state program responsibilities to local governments. Figure 1 summarizes the main provisions of this proposition, which are discussed in more detail below.<BR>  <BR>  <I>State Taxes and Revenues</I><BR>  - Increases sales tax rate by one-quarter cent for every dollar for four years.<BR>  - Increases personal income tax rates on upper-income taxpayers for seven years.<BR>  - Raises about $6 billion in additional annual state revenues from 2012–13 through 2016–17, with smaller amounts in 2011–12, 2017–18, and 2018–19.<BR>  <BR>  <I>State Spending</I><BR>  - If approved by voters, additional revenues available to help balance state budget through 2018–19.<BR>  - If rejected by voters, 2012–13 budget reduced by $6 billion. State revenues lower through 2018–19.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Local Government Programs</I><BR>  - Guarantees local governments receive tax revenues annually to fund program responsibilities transferred to them by the state in 2011.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increases Sales Tax Rate From 2013 Through 2016.</B></I> This measure temporarily increases the statewide sales tax rate by one-quarter cent for every dollar of goods purchased. This higher tax rate would be in effect for four years—from January 1, 2013 through the end of 2016.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increases Personal Income Tax Rates From 2012 Through 2018.</B></I> This measure increases the existing 9.3 percent PIT rates on higher incomes. The additional marginal tax rates would increase as taxable income increases. For joint filers, for example, an additional 1 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $500,000 and $600,000 per year, increasing the total rate to 10.3 percent. Similarly, an additional 2 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income between $600,000 and $1 million, and an additional 3 percent marginal tax rate would be imposed on income above $1 million, increasing the total rates on these income brackets to 11.3 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively. These new tax rates would affect about 1 percent of California PIT filers. (These taxpayers currently pay about 40 percent of state personal income taxes.) The tax rates would be in effect for seven years starting in the 2012 tax year and ending at the conclusion of the 2018 tax year. (Because the rate increase would apply as of January 1, 2012, affected taxpayers likely would have to make larger payments in the coming months to account for the full-year effect of the rate increase.) The additional 1 percent rate for mental health services would still apply to income in excess of $1 million. Proposition 30’s rate changes, therefore, would increase these taxpayers’ marginal PIT rate from 10.3 percent to 13.3 percent. Proposition 38 on this ballot would also increase PIT rates. The nearby box describes what would happen if both measures are approved.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Increases Sales Tax Rate From 2013 Through 2016.</B></I> This measure temporarily increases the statewide sales tax rate by one-quarter cent for every dollar of goods purchased.

A portion of the new revenues therefore would be used to support higher school funding, with the remainder helping to balance the state budget. From an accounting perspective, the new revenues would be deposited into a newly created state account called the Education Protection Account (EPA). Of the funds in the account, 89 percent would be provided to schools and 11 percent to community colleges. Schools and community colleges could use these funds for any educational purpose. The funds would be distributed the same way as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except that no school district would receive less than $200 in EPA funds per student and no community college district would receive less than $100 in EPA funds per full-time student.",Proposition 30,Initiative,Education: Higher Ed,General,0.5429999999999999,Amendment,1

459,California,2018,Decreasing Property Taxes for New Home Purchases by Homebuyers 55 and Older Amendment and Initiative,"According to the California Legislative Analyst's Office of the California Legislature: the measure would decrease the amount of property taxes collected, which means that state funds would need to be raised to replace those dollars since state law requires schools to receive a minimum of funding each year. And often a home's market value (what it can be sold for) is lower than the amount that the property is assessed at for tax purposes (since most property value increase higher than the 2% set in law for assessing purposes). Thus, someone who buys a new home often finds they have to pay higher property taxes. Currently a homeowners 55 and older may purchase a home in the same county and transfer their existing assessed value to the new home. Counties also adminster the property tax. This measure would expand the ability of homeowners 55 and older to transfer their existing home value. They could do so across county lines and to more expensive homes. For more expensive homes at the market rate value, the assessed property tax value for the 55 and older homebuyer would be adjusted up from that of the previous home but would not equal the potential assessed value of the new more expensive home. If the market rate of the new home is less than the current home, the assessed value of the prior home would be adjusted downward. There are no limits to the number of times a person can move and use the measure's provisions. Estimated effects include a likely increase in home sales but a decrease in property tax revenue and thus an increase in state revenue for schools.",Proposition 5,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.402,"Statutory, Amendment",0

489,Colorado,2000,Background Checks at Gun Shows,"Initiative Statute<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Requires background checks if any part of a gun purchase takes place at a gun show with the exception of antique guns, curios and relics; requires a designated licensed gun dealer to obtain background checks, and to keep records of purchases as he or she would when selling, renting, or exchanging at retail; defines a gun show as any event or function where 25 or more guns are offered or exhibited for sale,  transfer, or exchange, or at least three gun owners exhibit, sell, offer for sale, transfer, or exchange guns; and creates misdemeanor penalties punishable by jail, fines, or both.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  Federal law requires gun dealers ""people who are in the business of selling guns"" to be licensed.  Licensed gun dealers must request a background check and get approval prior to a gun sale.  Private individuals who occasionally sell or exchange guns are not required to be licensed, obtain a background check, or get approval prior to a sale.  People who want to buy guns at gun shows may choose to buy from either a licensed gun dealer or a private individual.<BR>  <BR>  This proposal requires at least one designated licensed gun dealer to obtain background checks on behalf of private individuals who sell guns at gun shows.  The licensed gun dealer may charge a fee of up to ten dollars for this service.  The proposal creates penalties for violations of its provisions, including providing false information for the background check and failing to request a background check and get approval prior to a gun sale.  The penalties include six to 24 months in jail, a fine of $500 to $5,000, or both.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact:  The Office of State Planning and Budgeting has determined that implementation of the measure would require a General Fund appropriation of between $357,383 and $494,211 for the first fiscal year of full implementation, which would include:<BR>  - 10 to 15 additional temporary employees;<BR>  - 2 to 3 additional full-time employees for appeals from denied purchases;<BR>  - additional leased space; and<BR>  - additional computer and capital expenses for 12 to 18 employees.<BR>  <BR>  There may be an additional cost for a web-based computer interface in the amount of approximately $578,060.<BR>  <BR>  The Office of State Planning and Budgeting has determined that implementation of the measure would require a General Fund appropriation of between $297,416 and $411,227 for the subsequent fiscal year, which would include:<BR>  - 10 to 15 temporary employees;<BR>  - 2 to 3 full-time employees for appeals from denied purchases; and<BR>  - leased space.<BR>  <BR>  There may be an additional cost of $31,500 for continuation of the web-based computer interface.  In addition to these costs, it is likely that there would be state and local costs for law enforcement and incarceration, but the amount of such costs is indeterminate.<BR>  [S]",Amendment 22,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.7,,1
490,Colorado,2000,Excess State Revenues for Math and Science Grants,"Legislative Statute<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Allows the state to keep and spend the first $50 million in excess of the  state's constitutional revenue limit for each of the next five years (up to $250 million total); specifies that these moneys be used to distribute grants to school districts for math and science programs; creates a 16-member review committee to administer the program and to award grants to school districts; gives priority to low-income and poorly performing school districts, and to programs with the greatest potential for improving academic performance in math and science; and excludes the money in the proposal from state and school district revenue and spending limits, and reduces taxpayer refunds.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:<BR>  Excess state revenue. The state constitution limits annual growth in state revenue to inflation and the annual percentage change in state population.  Revenue above this limit must be refunded to taxpayers unless the voters allow the state to keep and spend the excess state revenue. The proposal asks the voters to allow the state to keep and spend $50 million in excess state revenue for each of the next five years. If excess state revenue is less than $50 million in any year, the state would keep the entire amount. The proposal would reduce the average tax refund by approximately $18 per taxpayer or $36 for a married couple in each of the next five years. The total five-year impact would be $90 per taxpayer or $180 for a married couple.<BR>  <BR>  Establishment of a grant program for school funding. The proposal creates a 16-member committee to oversee a performance grant program to distribute money to school districts for math and science programs. The committee, which is authorized to establish rules for the administration of the program, will consist of the seven members of the State Board of Education, three members appointed by the Governor, three state Senators, and three state Representatives.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal sets forth requirements for grant applications and criteria for the committee to consider in awarding grants. Individual schools, including charter schools, must apply for the program through their local school district. In awarding grants, priority must be given to: school districts with an above average percentage of poor students; school districts with below average academic performance in math and science; and programs that have the greatest potential for improving student academic performance in math and science.",Referendum F,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.44,,0
491,Colorado,2000,Funding for Public Schools,"Initiative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Increases per pupil funding for public schools and total state funding for  special purpose education programs by at least the rate of inflation plus one percentage point for the next ten years and by at least the rate of inflation thereafter; sets aside a portion of the state's income tax revenue to establish the State Education Fund and exempts this money from state and school district revenue and spending limits, thereby decreasing tax refunds when excess revenue exists; allows moneys from the State Education Fund to be used to meet the funding requirements of the proposal; and requires state aid under the school finance act to increase by at least five percent annually.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  <BR>  Financing public school education.  Colorado public schools receive funding from a variety of sources.  Last year, public schools received an estimated $5.0 billion, for an average of $7,323 per pupil.  This proposal changes funding  received by schools under the state school finance act and for special purpose programs.  As indicated in Graph 1, about 70 percent of the total money received by schools was allocated through these two funding mechanisms.  Under current law, the legislature determines any increase or decrease in funding provided through these two mechanisms.  Under this proposal, the state constitution sets a minimum increase in funding.<BR>  <BR>  School finance act.  Under the school finance act, every school district starts with the same per pupil funding amount called the ""base.""  The base is then adjusted in each school district for special district characteristics such as the number of students and the local community's cost of living.  This proposal requires a minimum increase in the base equal to the rate of inflation plus one percentage point for the next ten years, and inflation thereafter.  This year, the base in the school finance act is $4,00o, which results in an average per pupil funding of $5,175.  Under the proposal, if inflation is 3.7 percent in each of the next ten years, the base will increase by at least 58 percent to $6,335, for an average per pupil funding level of $8,192.  Per pupil funding under the school finance act is paid for from state and local taxes.  On average, 57 percent comes from the state and 43 percent from local taxes.  The proposal requires the amount provided by the state to increase by at least five percent annually for the next ten years, unless Colorado personal income grows less than four and one-half percent between the two previous calendar years.  The state aid that would be affected by this proposal is $1.98 billion.  With five percent annual growth rate, the state aid in ten years must be at least $3.22 billion.<BR>  <BR>  Special purpose programs.  The state currently spends $140.5 million on special purpose programs which provide funding for transportation; English education for non-English-speaking students; expelled, suspended, and at-risk  students; special education, including gifted and talented students; vocational education; small attendance centers; and comprehensive health education.  This proposal requires a minimum increase in total funding for these and any other special purpose programs designated by the state legislature.  The increase must be equal to the rate of inflation plus one percentage point for the next ten years, and inflation thereafter.  If inflation is 3.7 percent in each of the next ten years, the $140.5 million will increase by at least 58 percent to $222 million.<BR>  <BR>  State Education Fund.  The proposal creates the State Education Fund and requires that the revenue from a tax of one-third of one percent of Colorado's taxable income be deposited in the fund every year.  Given the current income tax rate of 4.63 percent, one-third of one percent is 7.2 percent of the total state income tax collected.  State officials estimate revenue to the fund will total $313 million in 2001, growing to $638 million in 2010, and increasing each year thereafter.  The total for the first ten years is estimated to be $4.58 billion.  The state legislature can use money in the fund to pay for the increase in this proposal in the base under the school finance act, as long as it is in addition to the five percent increase in state aid.  The fund may also be used for the required increase in special purpose programs and for educational reforms, class size reduction, technology education, student safety programs, performance incentives for teachers, and public school building capital construction.<BR>  <BR>  Excess state revenues.  The state constitution limits most annual growth in state revenue to inflation and the annual percentage change in state population.  Revenue above this limit must be refunded to taxpayers unless the voters allow the state to keep and spend it.  Under current economic projections, moneys deposited in the State Education Fund under this proposal will reduce excess state revenues by $313 million in the first year and $4.58 billion over the first ten years.  This money would otherwise be refunded to taxpayers.  The proposal would reduce the average tax refund by approximately $113 per taxpayer or $226 for a married couple in the first year.  The total ten-year impact would be approximately $1,500 per taxpayer or $3,000 for a married couple.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact:  The Office of State Planning and Budgeting foresees that the measure will have a state fiscal impact based on the increases in funding for preschool through twelfth grade public education and categorical funding and the increases in total program funding required by the measure.  In addition, the measure excludes approximately $320 million in revenue from the constitutional limitation on fiscal year revenue.  In good economic times, such as the State is currently experiencing, this means that the amount of excess revenues that must be refunded to citizens will be reduced by approximately $320 million.  The $320 million not refunded would then be available to offset the cost of the increased funding for education that is required by the measure. However, when economic conditions are poor, excess revenues may decline over time.  Under these circumstances, this measure may require decreases in funding for other State programs.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 23,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.53,,1
492,Colorado,2000,Legislative Reapportionment Timetable,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council: revises the timetable for redrawing and approving state Senate and  House of Representative districts.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  Every ten years, the boundaries of state Senate and House of Representatives districts are redrawn after receiving final population figures from the federal census. The state constitution requires that an 11-member Reapportionment Commission redraw the district lines to comply with the ""one person, one vote"" principle and other constitutional criteria. Currently, the entire legislative reapportionment process runs from July 1st to the following March 15th.  This proposal permanently changes this timetable by moving up the start of the legislative reapportionment process to April 15th, allowing additional time for certain steps in the process, and completing the process by mid-February of the next year. Within this timetable are specific deadlines for appointment of commission members, preparation of a preliminary plan, completion of public hearings, adoption and submittal of a final plan and related legal materials to the Colorado Supreme Court, and filing the plan with the Secretary of State. Once the final plan is filed with the Secretary of State, county clerks redraw precinct boundaries before precinct caucuses are held the second Tuesday in April.",Referendum B,Legislative Referendum,Redistricting,General,0.6,,1
493,Colorado,2000,Medical Use of Marijuana,"Initiative Constitutional Amendment.<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Allows patients diagnosed with a serious or chronic illness and their care-givers to legally possess marijuana for medical purposes.  For a patient unable to administer marijuana to himself or herself, or for minors under 18, care-givers determine the amount and frequency of use; allows a doctor to legally provide a seriously or chronically ill patient with a written statement that the patient might benefit from medical use of marijuana; and establishes a confidential state registry of patients and their care-givers who are permitted to possess marijuana for medical purposes.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  Current Colorado and federal criminal law prohibits the possession, distribution, and use of marijuana.  The proposal does not affect federal criminal laws, but amends the Colorado Constitution to legalize the medical use of marijuana for patients who have registered with the state.  Qualifying medical conditions include cancer, glaucoma, AIDS/HIV, some neurological and movement disorders such as multiple sclerosis, and any other medical condition approved by the state.  A doctor's signed statement or a copy of the patient's pertinent medical records indicating that the patient might benefit from marijuana is necessary for a patient to register  Individuals on the registry may possess up to two ounces of usable marijuana and six marijuana plants.  Because the proposal does not change current law, distribution of marijuana will still be illegal in Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  Patients on the registry are allowed to legally acquire, possess, use, grow, and transport marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia.  Employers are not required to allow the medical use of marijuana in the workplace.  Marijuana may not be used in any place open to the public, and insurance companies are not required to reimburse a patient's claim for costs incurred through the medical use of marijuana.  Finally, for a patient who is under the age of 18, the proposal requires statements from two doctors and written consent from any parent living in Colorado to register the patient.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact:  The Office of State Planning and Budgeting estimates that the measure would have a fiscal impact of $402,299 in fiscal year 1998-99 and $342,157 in fiscal year 1999-2000, attributable to the establishment and administration of a registry in the department of public health and environment.  The state health agency is authorized to levy fees to pay direct or indirect administrative costs associated with its role in this program, and the Office of State Planning and Budgeting projects that the registry would be funded solely through such fees on potential registry clients.  However, because the criminal penalties are not defined in the measure, the Office of State Planning and Budgeting has stated that the fiscal impact of the measure on the department of public safety, the judicial department, and the department of corrections is indeterminate; accordingly, the overall fiscal impact of the measure on state government for fiscal year 1998-99 is indeterminate.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 20,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.54,,1
494,Colorado,2000,Multi-State Lotteries,"Legislative Statute<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Makes multi-state lotteries legal in Colorado; authorizes the state to enter into agreements for multi-state lotteries; distributes most new lottery revenues in the same way that current lottery revenues are distributed, but reallocates a portion from general government purposes to alleviate public school health and safety hazards; and exempts revenue from multi-state lotteries from state revenue and  spending limits.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  Colorado currently operates a state lottery that includes both scratch games and on-line games such as Lotto. This proposal allows the state's existing lottery to include games played with other state lotteries. Under this proposal, the state could either negotiate to join an existing multi-state lottery game or work with other states to develop a new multi-state game. Multi-state games involve a larger population of players than Colorado's existing lottery games, thus they offer potentially larger prizes but fewer chances of winning the jackpot for each wager. Currently, there are eight multi-state games, the largest of which are Powerball (20 states), Cash 4 Life (10 states), and the Big Game (seven states).<BR>  <BR>  Proceeds from Colorado lottery games, after prizes and administrative expenses, are distributed to local governments, the state, and the Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) Board to purchase and maintain state and local  parks and recreation facilities, wildlife habitats, and open space. The amount of money dedicated to GOCO is capped, however, and any ""spillover"" money in excess of the cap is deposited in the state's general operating fund. Proceeds from multi-state games would be distributed the same as under current law, with two exceptions. First, any spillover would be used for health and safety projects at public school buildings instead of general state government  purposes and, second, the spillover would be exempt from the state's constitutional revenue limit. While the actual amount of additional proceeds raised by a multi-state lottery game is unknown, each five percent increase in lottery proceeds raises about four million dollars for parks, wildlife habitats, and open space. Lottery proceeds would have to increase by at least 17 percent, or $13.5 million, to make moneys available in the current budget year for school health and safety projects.<BR>  <BR>  Under the proposal, the Colorado Lottery Commission negotiates agreements with other state lottery commissions. The agreements govern which multi-state games are available in Colorado, the rules of play for each game, and the portion of ticket sales that go for prizes. The Colorado Lottery Commission controls advertising, promotion, and security of the game. The commission remains subject to the state constitutional requirement that all lottery games be supervised by the state.",Referendum E,Legislative Referendum,Gambling & Lotteries,General,0.52,,1
495,Colorado,2000,Outdated Constitutional Provisions,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Strikes references to one-time events that have already occurred and to public offices that no longer exist, and removes provisions that have expired or are outdated.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  References to one-time events. The proposal strikes from the constitution several provisions relating to events that occurred in the past. These include provisions regarding who was eligible to run for a seat in the first state legislature, one-year extensions of the terms of certain county officers elected in 1904, 1906 and 1954, and a one-time exception in 1968 to the prohibition on increasing the pay of county officers while they are in office. Also, it eliminates a provision that nullified Colorado liquor laws existing before July 1, 1933. This provision was adopted as a result of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, which repealed liquor prohibition in 1933.<BR>  <BR>  Public offices that no longer exist. The proposal strikes references to ""justices of the peace"" and ""constables."" These offices were eliminated in 1961 when Colorado's judicial system was modernized and reorganized. It also eliminates the requirement that counties elect a county superintendent of schools since a separate provision of the constitution gives counties the option of abolishing this office. Beginning in the 1960s, the role of the county superintendent of schools was gradually assumed by school districts, and all Colorado counties subsequently eliminated these offices.<BR>  <BR>  Expired provisions. Two expired provisions relate to the implementation of the state constitution in 1876. The first provision prohibits railroads and transportation companies existing at that time from benefiting from future state  legislation unless they filed an acceptance of the constitution with the Secretary of State. The second provision invalidates corporate charters that were granted to corporations prior to 1876, but which were not used as of the adoption of the constitution.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal also deletes the procedures by which the first charter of the City and County of Denver was adopted in 1881. The ability of Denver residents to make and amend their charter is not changed. The last expired constitutional provision relates to governing bodies of ""service authorities."" In 1970, the constitution was amended to allow for the creation of these authorities to provide services such as water treatment, transportation and fire protection. For the first five years after their creation, the governing bodies of service authorities could only include members of city or town councils, mayors, or county commissioners.  This restriction expired in 1980.<BR>  <BR>  Outdated provisions. A reference to election of legislators from the county in which they live is deleted since all Colorado legislators are now elected from districts. Finally, language that requires officers of the City and County of Denver to be paid monthly is deleted.",Referendum D,Legislative Referendum,Legislatures,General,0.72,,1
496,Colorado,2000,Property Tax Reduction for Senior Citizens,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council: reduces property taxes for qualified senior citizens by exempting up to  one-half, but not to exceed $100,000, of the value of a home from property taxation; makes the property tax reduction available to persons 65 years of age or older who have owned and lived in their homes for the preceding ten years; requires the state to reimburse local governments for any property tax revenue reduction resulting from this proposal; and excludes the state reimbursement to local governments from state and local revenue and spending limits.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  In Colorado, property taxes fund local government services, such as schools, police, fire protection, and recreation facilities. This proposal lowers property taxes for qualified senior citizens by subtracting a portion of a home's value to determine the amount of property taxes owed. The portion of a home's value that is subtracted or exempted to reduce property taxes is referred to as a homestead exemption.<BR>  <BR>  Property tax reduction. Homeowners pay property taxes based on the value of their home and the tax rate set by the local governments where they live. This proposal reduces the taxable value of a home by one-half of the first $200,000 of a home's value, thereby lowering property taxes for those who qualify.  Homeowners with homes valued at $200,000 and under receive the largest percentage tax reduction. The percentage reduction in property taxes decreases as the home value increases above $200,000. The dollar amount of the tax reduction will vary depending upon the local property tax rate. The state legislature can adjust the $200,000 cap on the home value to either increase or decrease the benefit from the homestead exemption in future years.<BR>  <BR>  Impact of the proposal. This proposal affects property taxes paid beginning in 2003. About 107,700 homes are expected to qualify for the property tax reduction, and the average property tax savings for those who qualify will be  about $410. The total reduction in property taxes is estimated to be about $44 million in the first year, which amounts to about 1.4 percent of all property taxes collected. The state is required to reimburse all local governments for the reduction in property tax revenue resulting from the proposal.<BR>  <BR>  Excess state revenues. The state constitution limits most of the money that the state can collect each year to inflation plus the percentage change in state population. Money above this limit must be refunded to taxpayers unless the voters allow the state to keep and spend the excess state revenue. For the purpose of reimbursing local governments, this proposal asks the voters to allow the state to refund $44 million less in the first year. This amount would increase by about $2.3 million each year thereafter. Under current law, if there is excess revenue, the proposal would reduce the average first year tax refund by approximately $15 per taxpayer or $30 for a married couple. The reduction in the tax refund would increase slightly each year thereafter.",Referendum A,Legislative Referendum,Human Services,General,0.55,,1
497,Colorado,2000,Requirements for Consent to Abortion,"Initiative Statute<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council: requires a doctor and licensed health care or mental health care  professional working with a doctor to present specific information to a woman before an abortion; requires a 24-hour waiting period between the time the information is provided and an abortion is performed, except in cases of medical emergency; requires the woman to certify, in writing, that she was provided the information; requires the state to publish and annually update an informational packet and videotape; and creates criminal penalties and civil remedies for violating the provisions of the proposal.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal<BR>  As a matter of practice, doctors explain the risks, benefits, and alternatives of any medical procedure to patients and require them to sign written consent forms before performing any procedure.  This proposal places requirements in state law for obtaining consent before performing an abortion.  Under these requirements, a doctor must meet privately with any woman seeking an abortion at least 24 hours before the procedure and discuss the following information with her:<BR>  - the abortion procedure, including the name of the doctor who will perform the abortion, a medically accurate and complete description of the abortion method, the need for anti-Rh immune globulin therapy, and follow-up care provided by the clinic;<BR>  - alternatives to an abortion;<BR>  - the medical risks of an abortion and of carrying a child to term, including, for abortions, the risks of infection or hemorrhage, danger to subsequent pregnancies, breast cancer, and the possible adverse psychological effects; and<BR>  - details about the fetus, including the probable gestational age and physical characteristics of the fetus at the time of the abortion, the ability of the fetus to survive outside of the womb, and whether the procedure would be likely to inflict pain on the fetus.<BR>  <BR>  A doctor or a licensed professional working with the doctor must also discuss medical assistance benefits that may be available for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care; the financial obligations of the father; and the woman's ability to withhold or withdraw her consent to the abortion at any time before or during the abortion.<BR>  <BR>  Exceptions for medical emergencies.  The proposal contains an exception to the consent requirement and the 24-hour waiting period in the case of a medical emergency.  A medical emergency is a condition that, in the doctor's judgment, would cause a woman's death or substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.<BR>  <BR>  Materials provided by the state.  Each year, the state must publish materials and a videotape which include information about agencies offering alternatives to abortion, and agencies and services available to assist pregnant women.  In addition, the state must establish a toll-free 24-hour telephone hotline to provide a list and description of these agencies and services.  The materials and videotape include information about the support obligations of the father, and descriptions and photographs of a fetus at two-week increments.  The videotape shows an ultrasound image of a fetal heartbeat at various gestational increments beginning at four weeks.  The materials and videotape will be available from the state at no cost.  Doctors must offer these materials to a woman at least 24 hours before an abortion.<BR>  <BR>  Reporting requirements.  Doctors are required to annually submit reports to the state indicating how many women were provided abortion information, how many received a copy of printed materials, how many refused the printed materials, and how many had an abortion.  The doctor must also indicate the number of abortions performed under emergency circumstances.  The state must annually publish a report of this information.<BR>  <BR>  Penalties.  A doctor who fails to provide the required information prior to an abortion, who fails to obtain the woman's written consent, or who fraudulently certifies that the information was provided or consent obtained is guilty of a Class 5 felony, punishable by up to three years imprisonment, fines of up to $100,000, or both.  Any person who fails to report the required information to the state is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, punishable by up to 18 months in jail, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.  Failure to comply with these requirements may also be the  basis for disciplinary action against the doctor's license and civil malpractice lawsuits.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact.  The Office of State Planning and Budgeting has determined that implementation of the measure would result in a negative fiscal impact on the department of public health and environment in the amount of $327,125 in FY 2000-01 and $175,569 in FY 2001-02. These amounts include:<BR>  1. Development, production, and distribution of video and audio materials;<BR>  2. Design and maintenance of a 24-hour hotline;<BR>  3. Personal services costs equal to 2.75 FTE in the first year and 1.25 FTE in the second year; and<BR>  4.

498,Colorado,2000,Selection of County Surveyors,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Adds the option of appointing a county surveyor to the existing requirement that surveyors be elected; and allows the state legislature to determine when and how the county surveyor position is to be elected or appointed.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:<BR>  What is a county surveyor? County surveyors are elected at the county level and may serve up to two four-year terms. Once in office, county surveyors are required by law to represent the county in boundary disputes with other counties, notify the county attorney of boundary disputes, or establish landmarks in the surveying process. County surveyors are also responsible for filing all survey records authorized and financed by the board of county commissioners. If authorized by the board of county commissioners, a county surveyor may also conduct surveys to establish the boundaries of county property, keep records of all known survey points in the county, and examine survey maps and plats before they are recorded by the county clerk and recorder. To qualify for the position of county surveyor, an individual must be licensed as a professional land surveyor in Colorado. Elected surveyors must be residents of the county in which they serve.<BR>  <BR>  How many counties have a surveyor? A total of 27 of the 60 counties to which the amendment applies have an elected surveyor. (The proposal does not affect the three counties with home rule authority: Denver, Pitkin, and Weld.) Two of these 27 counties have a full-time surveyor, and the other 25 surveyors serve on a part-time or as-needed basis. The remaining 33 counties do not have an elected surveyor. When there are no candidates for the office and the office is vacant after an election, the board of county commissioners is allowed to appoint a licensed land surveyor to fill the position. Seven of the counties without an elected surveyor have filled the office by appointment. A county has the option to contract with a private firm for survey work when needed rather than fill the office with an appointed official. When appointed, the surveyor need not be a resident of the county. The county commissioners may also have other county employees assume some of the responsibilities of the county surveyor, although only a licensed professional land surveyor can do land surveying.",Referendum C,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.46,,0
499,Colorado,2000,Tax Cuts,"Initiative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  cuts the taxes which fund certain basic local and state services by $25 per year including property, income, utility, and vehicle taxes; increases the amount of each tax cut by $25 per year in perpetuity or until the tax and the services paid for by the tax are eliminated or until the services are paid for in some other way; prohibits the provisions of the proposal from reducing the amount of state or local revenue that must be refunded to taxpayers under current law; and requires that a husband and wife each receive the tax cuts that affect state income taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  The proposal provides for an initial $25 tax cut for several local and state taxes.  Most of the local and state taxes which this proposal will reduce are used to provide government services including: fire protection, law enforcement, libraries, schools, highway and mass transit projects, prisons, and other special district services like emergency and hospital care, water, and soil conservation.  A portion of the taxes are allocated for other specific purposes, such as the repayment of bonds.  When the local and state governments each impose a particular tax, the tax cut applies to each tax imposed.  The amount of each tax cut increases by $25 per year, up to the amount of the tax paid.  For example, if an annual tax bill is $70, the tax will be reduced $25 in the first year and $50 in the second year, and the tax bill will only be eligible for an additional $20 cut in the third year.<BR>  <BR>  Property tax.  All counties and school districts and most cities and special districts impose a property tax. Property taxes are reduced in two ways.  First, each local government's tax is directly reduced, and then it is reduced to rebate any sales tax revenue collected by the local government on food and nonalcoholic beverages sold at grocery stores and restaurants.  Most property owners pay property taxes.  Property taxes are paid to multiple local governments, and the tax cuts will apply to each government’s property tax.  Owners of multiple properties are entitled to tax cuts for each property.  The property tax cuts begin with bills received in 2002.<BR>  <BR>  Income tax.  Three of the tax cuts affect the state's income tax.  First, individual and corporate income taxes are directly cut.  Next, income taxes are cut to return the amount of sales tax that the state collects on food and nonalcoholic beverages sold at restaurants.  Finally, income taxes are cut to return the money the state receives from the estate tax.  The amount returned for taxes on food and nonalcoholic beverages is expected to increase to $75 per taxpayer in the third year, but to less than $100 in the fourth year.  The amount returned for estate taxes is expected to be $25 in the first year, but less than $50 in the second year.  The income tax cuts begin with income tax returns filed in 2002.<BR>  <BR>  Utility taxes and charges.  This proposal affects taxes and franchise charges paid on utility services.  While the proposal does not define “utility,” common examples of a utility are gas, electric, and telephone service providers.   Homeowners and renters do not pay state sales taxes on their gas and electric bills, but in most cases pay local taxes on these bills.  Telephone bills can include sales taxes for services for regular telephones, cellular telephones, pagers, and other telecommunications equipment.  The tax cuts for utility taxes and charges begin in 2001.<BR>  <BR>  Vehicle taxes.  The state, a few special districts such as RTD and the baseball stadium district, and most cities and counties impose a sales tax when a vehicle is purchased.  The tax cut applies to the state sales tax and each local sales tax.  In addition to sales tax, a vehicle ownership tax is paid annually when a vehicle is registered.  Revenue from the vehicle ownership tax is allocated to local governments that collect property taxes.  The vehicle ownership tax declines as a vehicle ages.  The tax cut for each vehicle tax begins in 2001. <BR>  <BR>  Impact of proposal on taxpayers and governments.  The tax cuts would total $234 million in 2001, $843 million in 2002, and $1.3 billion in 2003.<BR>  <BR>  The actual tax reductions for any household will depend on several factors.  Some of these factors are the number and age of vehicles owned, vehicle purchases, actual utility expenses, the local sales tax rates, the number of  property tax districts and their mill levies, and whether a taxpayer owns property and pays income taxes.  Tax reductions that occur due to this proposal do not take into account increases in federal income taxes for those taxpayers who deduct their property, income, and vehicle ownership taxes.<BR>  <BR>  State replacement of local revenue.  This proposal does not require the state to replace the money that local governments will lose as a result of this proposal.  However, this proposal does prohibit the state from using TABOR-related excess revenues to replace the revenue that will be lost by local governments due to this proposal. Without state replacement of lost local revenue, and absent a voter-approved increase in the tax rate, many local  governments will face significant declines in revenue.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 21,Initiative,Tax & Revenue,General,0.34,,0
500,Colorado,2000,Voter Approval of Growth,"Initiative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Analysis by Colorado Legislative Council:  Requires voter approval of maps, called ""growth area maps,"" that identify areas for future development in counties, cities, and towns of a certain population; requires affected local governments to designate areas called ""committed areas,"" in which development may occur without voter approval because the areas meet certain qualifications; requires affected counties, cities, and towns to provide information to  voters about the impacts of proposed growth; and exempts local governments below a certain population, and some types of development, from its requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Background and Provisions of the Proposal:  Current regulation of development. Colorado law gives counties, cities, and towns broad authority over the development of land.  Counties regulate development in areas of the county outside of city limits, while cities and towns regulate development within their boundaries.  To develop land, builders and property owners must satisfy local government regulations including zoning ordinances, building codes, and subdivision and platting requirements.  Cities and towns may expand their boundaries by annexing land that is not part of another city or town.  Local regulations are often quite detailed and consist of many steps, including review by local planning departments, public hearings before planning commissions, and public hearings and approval by boards of county commissioners or town or city councils.<BR>  <BR>  Many local governments have planning commissions that create master plans to advise elected officials on development of land in their jurisdictions. Counties are required to have planning commissions; cities and towns are authorized, but not required, to have them. Local governments hold public hearings when creating or changing a master plan.  Any proposal to develop land must comply with master plans that have been adopted as a local ordinance. If a master plan has not been placed in ordinance by a local government then local governments may approve development that is not consistent with these plans, or deny development that is consistent with these plans.<BR>  <BR>  Voter approval of growth area maps.  Local governments subject to the proposal may propose maps to voters that show the geographic areas where they want new development to occur.  These maps ""with a text describing the  proposed growth area"" will identify the general locations of proposed land uses and development densities within these areas.  Growth area maps must be proposed to the voters if the local government seeks to grow beyond certain  areas designated for development.  Voters must approve the growth area maps before new development may occur.  Growth area maps may be adopted or changed once each year at a November election.<BR>     <BR>  Local governments may propose new growth areas only where the development will be served by roads and central water and sewer within ten years.  Growth areas for municipalities must share at least one-sixth of their borders with areas that have already been committed to development by a local government or with other areas that have been approved by the voters as growth areas.  The proposal also requires local governments to coordinate their proposed growth maps so that the maps are consistent with those of adjoining cities, towns, and counties.  Public hearings must be held on proposed growth area maps.<BR>  <BR>  Before a vote on a growth area map, local governments must mail to voters information describing the elements of the growth area including open spaces and parks, new public facilities and infrastructure, number of new housing units, and any local government revenue sharing arrangements.  In addition, information must be mailed to voters on the anticipated effects of the proposed growth on population, traffic, air quality, and water supplies.<BR>  <BR>  Areas committed to growth.  Voter approval is not needed for development to occur in areas that have been designated by local governments as committed areas.  To qualify as a committed area, a valid development application must have been submitted to the local government by September 13, 2000, or certain levels of construction must have already occurred on or around the land to be designated as a committed area.  These areas must be identified by December 31, 2001, or within one year after a local government meets the population threshold in the proposal, whichever is later.<BR>  <BR>  Local governments affected by the proposal.  Counties with populations greater than 10,000, and cities and towns within these counties with populations greater than 1,000 are subject to the proposal.  However, counties with fewer than 25,000 residents may vote to exempt themselves, and all cities and towns within the county, from all requirements for up to four years at a time.  Cities and towns that have any part of their territory in a county subject to the proposal must also comply.  Towns under 1,000 population in counties to which the proposal applies are only required to determine areas that have been committed to development.  The population of a city, town or county will be determined by the most recent census data or applicable population projection.<BR>  <BR>  Based on their current populations, the following counties are subject to the proposal: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, Eagle, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Montrose, Morgan, Pueblo, and Weld. Voters in the following counties may exempt themselves from the proposal: Alamosa, Chaffee, Elbert, Grand, Gunnison, Las Animas, Logan, Moffat, Montezuma, Otero, Park, Pitkin, Prowers, Rio Grande, Routt, Summit, and Teller. All other counties are currently exempt from the proposal's requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Development exempt from the proposal.  Development related to water facilities, telecommunications, utilities, mining, and oil and gas is exempt from the proposal; road construction within growth areas is not.  Local governments may approve the following types of development outside of growth areas and committed areas without voter approval:<BR>  - construction that does not require any further local government approval, only lacks the issuance of a building permit, or for which a development application was accepted by a local government as valid on or before September 13, 2000;<BR>  - certain public facilities, groupings of new homes in rural areas that leave two-thirds of the land for open space, divisions of land greater than 35 acres that are not currently subject to county subdivision regulations, and  certain small lots for farm families; and<BR>  - certain retail and service businesses of less than 10,000 square feet and businesses that serve farmers and ranchers, other than confined animal feeding operations, as long as they are located at least one mile apart.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact:  State impacts.  The proponents intend that existing estimates be used to satisfy requirements for municipal population data.  If that approach is adopted, there will be no significant state fiscal impacts.  If new projections are required, the Department of Local Affairs estimates that it would require an additional six full-time employees at a cost of $347,846 to fulfill the requirements of the measure.  At this time, there does not appear to be any additional state fiscal impact.<BR>  <BR>  Local impacts.  Actual fiscal impacts on local governments are indeterminate.  Local governments would assume direct costs in complying with the following five tasks required by the measure:<BR>  1) Delineating ""committed areas""; <BR>  2) Developing ""growth area maps"";<BR>  3) Referring growth area maps to a popular vote at a regular election;<BR>  4) Providing growth impact disclosures; and<BR>  5) Distributing the growth area map and associated impact disclosures to voters.<BR>  <BR>  The Department of Local Affairs estimates that the aggregate total direct costs of initial compliance with these five requirements on the part of local governments could possibly be as high as $60 million.  Only limited data exists regarding the cost to local governments of complying with an additional requirement under the measure:  Ensuring that growth area maps are consistent with growth proposed by other local governments.  These costs could be similar in magnitude to those associated with delineating committed areas and developing growth area maps.<BR>  <BR>  Estimates of direct costs do not include the cost of updating zoning or other land use regulations in order to achieve consistency with committed areas and growth areas or the cost to be incurred by other political subdivisions (such as special districts or school districts) in complying with the measure as required by section 6 of the measure.<BR>  <BR>  In the event of an unsuccessful election or in the event that growth area maps are revised in the future to reflect changing conditions, these direct costs will continue forward as recurring costs associated with local government planning efforts.<BR>  <BR>  Indirect fiscal impacts on local governments are indeterminate.  Possible indirect positive fiscal impacts to local governments would result from the control and possible reduction of some of the negative impacts of growth cited in section 1 (""Purpose"") of the measure.  There could be a significant reduction in the cost of building new roads and extending water and sewer service to low density development.  It is impossible to quantify the dollar value of these positive impacts.<BR>  <BR>  Indirect negative impacts are similarly impossible to quantify and thus are also indeterminate.  The measure could result in negative fiscal impacts from delays in, or prohibition of, certain development, either in the short term as growth area maps are created and voted upon along with other planning tasks imposed by the measure or in the long term should citizens vote to curtail certain development.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 24,Initiative,Elections,General,0.3,,0
501,Colorado,2001,GOCO Bonds for Open Space,"The ballot question allows the board of directors of Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) to borrow money to assist local governments, state agencies, and nonprofit land conservation organizations with the preservation of land for open space, parks, and wildlife habitat by issuing bonds that would be repaid from lottery proceeds; and limits the amount of money that GOCO may borrow to $115 million and the total repayment cost, including interest, to $180 million with no increase in taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  What is GOCO?<BR>   The Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) program was created in 1992 to distribute a portion of the proceeds from the Colorado Lottery in substantially equal shares to four categories: wildlife, outdoor recreation, open space, and related local government projects.  GOCO awards grants to cities and towns, park and recreation districts, nonprofit land conservation organizations, the Colorado Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife.  Some GOCO grants are used to buy land, although GOCO cannot acquire land in its own name.  GOCO is governed by a 15-member board appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the state Senate.<BR>  <BR>  Under the Colorado Constitution, GOCO receives 50 percent of the state's net lottery proceeds, up to a cap that is adjusted for inflation each year.  Last year, GOCO's share of the lottery proceeds was $39.5 million.  Through June 2001, GOCO awarded $265.9 million in grants for 1,678 projects across the state.<BR>  <BR>  What does this ballot proposal allow?<BR>  The proposal allows GOCO to borrow up to $115 million to help acquire land.  The total repayment cost on the borrowed money (both principal and interest) cannot exceed $180 million.  Any borrowed money must be repaid within 20 years from GOCO's future lottery revenues.<BR>  <BR>  GOCO may borrow money only for permanent land acquisitions that the board determines are urgent.  The borrowed money may be used to finance the purchase of both land and perpetual conservation easements, which permanently restrict how a parcel of land is used.  GOCO decides whether and when to borrow money, the interest rate and length of borrowing, and which parcels of land to buy with borrowed money.<BR>  <BR>  How does borrowing affect the amount of land that can be purchased?<BR>  The relationship between the rate of change in land prices and the cost of borrowing determines how much land can be purchased under this proposal.  If land prices increase at a faster rate than the interest rate on the borrowed money, borrowing allows GOCO to finance the purchase of more land.  If the value of land that is acquired under this proposal declines or increases at a slower rate than the interest rate paid on the bonds, borrowing reduces the amount of land that can be purchased.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  The proposal authorizes GOCO to issue up to $115 million in debt, with a maximum repayment cost, including interest, of $180 million.  The term of any debt is limited to 20 years.  The proposal does not increase state or local taxes, nor does it affect the amount of taxpayer refunds from either the state or local governments.",Referendum A,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.5760000000000001,,1
502,Colorado,2001,Surplus Revenue to Test I-70 Fixed Guideway,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Revised Statutes allows the expenditure of $50 million of surplus state revenue to plan and test a fixed guideway transportation system for the I-70 corridor linking Denver International Airport and Eagle County Airport; and exempts the Colorado Intermountain Fixed Guideway Authority from state constitutional revenue and spending limitations.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Surplus state revenue.<BR>  The state constitution limits annual growth in most state revenue to the sum of the annual percentage changes in inflation and population.  Revenue above this limit must be refunded to taxpayers unless the voters allow the state to keep and spend all or a portion of the surplus state revenue.  The proposal asks voters to allow the Colorado Intermountain Fixed Guideway Authority to spend $50 million of the $927 million surplus from last year.  Spending this $50 million would reduce an individual taxpayer's estimated average tax refund of $221 by about $19 and a couple's estimated refund of $442 by about $38 in 2002.<BR>  <BR>  Transportation studies for the I-70 mountain corridor.<BR>  In 1998, the Colorado Department of Transportation completed a study of alternative strategies for increasing traffic capacity in the I-70 mountain corridor.  This initial study recommended the construction of a high-speed ""fixed guideway system"" as a long-term alternative for the corridor, plus a program of additional roadway improvements in the near term.  In 2004, the Department of Transportation will complete a second study that will fully evaluate transportation options for I-70 and will determine the appropriate solution for the corridor.  Examples of fixed guideway systems include light rail trains, passenger rail trains, and monorails.<BR>  <BR>  The Colorado Intermountain Fixed Guideway Authority.<BR>  The state legislature created the Colorado Intermountain Fixed Guideway Authority in 1998.  The Authority was directed to analyze fixed guideway technologies and to develop a plan for the design, financing, and construction of a fixed guideway system in the I-70 corridor from Denver International Airport (DIA) to Eagle County Airport.<BR>  <BR>  The Authority evaluated potential fixed guideway technologies and decided to pursue testing of a high-speed, elevated monorail system that relies on magnetic propulsion and braking and is designed to climb steep grades at high speeds.  The proposal requires the $50 million of surplus revenue to be spent on testing the monorail's motor and vehicles and on verifying construction and operating costs.  Funding for construction of the line would be sought at a later date.  The proposal gives the Authority three years to test the monorail system, and testing must occur at the national rail technology test center in Pueblo.  If the entire $50 million is not spent before January 1, 2005, the balance must be returned to the state.<BR>  <BR>  If a monorail line is built, it would run from DIA to Eagle County Airport, making stops on its route across metropolitan Denver and through the mountain communities along I-70.  In that case, the Authority expects to build the first segment of the line between DIA and downtown Denver.<BR>  <BR>  The Authority is governed by a 12-member board, which is appointed by the Governor, the leadership of the state legislature, and the governing bodies of cities and counties within the Authority's territory:  the cities of Denver and Aurora, and Clear Creek, Jefferson, Eagle, Garfield, and Summit counties.  The board is comprised of a member of the Colorado Transportation Commission and members of various professions and industries, including the transportation and tourism industries.<BR>  [S]",Amendment 26,Initiative,Transportation,General,0.341,,0
503,Colorado,2002,Campaign Finance,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Constitution:<BR>  - reduces the amount of money that individuals and political committees can contribute to candidates and various political organizations;<BR>  - limits the amount of money that political parties can contribute to candidates;<BR>  - creates small donor committees which may accept up to $50 per individual per year, and limits the amount of money they can contribute to candidates and political parties;<BR>  - sets voluntary spending limits for political races and establishes incentives for candidates to accept the spending limit;<BR>  - adjusts contribution and spending limits for inflation every four years; and<BR>  - requires reporting and disclosure of money spent for certain political advertisements.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Campaign finance is regulated by federal law for candidates in federal races; Colorado law regulates campaign finance for state and local candidates. Courts have also been involved in campaign finance by setting limits on what such laws can regulate and ruling on specific federal and state campaign finance provisions. This proposal changes Colorado campaign finance law and places the changes in the state Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Contribution to Candidates:<BR>  - A contribution from an individual to a candidate for a statewide office would be limited to $500 per election; $200 per election to candidates for the legislature, Board of Education, Board of Regents, and district attorney.<BR>  - Contributions from a political party to a candidate for governor would be limited to $500,000 per election cycle; $100,000 to candidates for other statewide offices; $18,000 to a candidate for state senate; and $13,000 to candidates for the state house of representatives, Board of Education, Board of Regents, and district attorney.  Presently, contributions from political parties are not limited.<BR>  - Contributions from corporate and union sources would be prohibited.  However, corporations and labor unions would be permitted to form political action committees and small donor committees which would be permitted to contribute to candidates.  Under current law, corporate and union contributions are not limited.<BR>  <BR>  All of the above contribution limits are doubled for a candidate who accepts voluntary spending limits if his/her opponent has not accepted the spending limit and has raised more than 10% of the spending limit.<BR>  <BR>  In addition to limiting contributions to candidates, the proposal limits the amount of money that individuals and various organizations may contribute to political parties, political committees, and small donor committees, as follows. <BR>  <BR>  Contributions to Political Parties<BR>  - Under current law, individuals, organizations, and political committees can annually contribute up to $25,000 to each affiliate of a political party, including state, county, district, and local affiliates. The proposal limits contributions to a total of $3,000 for all affiliates of a political party. Of the $3,000, the state-level political party affiliate may receive no more than $2,500.<BR>  - The proposal also limits the amount of money that small donor committees can annually contribute to all affiliates within a political party to $15,000 combined. Of the $15,000, the state-level political party affiliate may receive no more than $12,500.<BR>  - Corporations and labor unions cannot contribute to political parties.<BR>  <BR>  Contributions to Political Committees<BR>  - The proposal reduces the amount of money that individuals and organizations can contribute to political committees from $25,000 per year to $500 every two years.<BR>  <BR>  Contributions to Small Donor Committees<BR>  - The proposal caps individual contributions to a small donor committee at $50 per year.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, political committees are not allowed to knowingly accept contributions from non-U.S. citizens, foreign governments, or foreign corporations that do not have authority to do business in Colorado. The proposal extends the prohibition to candidates, small donor committees, and political parties.<BR>  <BR>  Voluntary spending limits.<BR>  The proposal establishes voluntary campaign spending limits.  Current law does not contain any such limits.  The proposed limits range from $2.5 million for candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, to $65,000 for candidates for Board of Education, Board of Regents, and district attorney.<BR>  <BR>  A candidate's decision to accept the spending limits is binding unless an opponent running for the same office does not accept the limits. Candidates who agree to spending limits may advertise their compliance in political messages. When a candidate agrees to limit spending but an opponent does not, the candidate may receive double the maximum contributions if the opponent has raised more than ten percent of the spending limit. Any personal money the candidate uses for his or her campaign counts as a political party contribution. Candidates who exceed the spending limits after agreeing to voluntarily limit campaign spending can be fined.<BR>  <BR>  Adjustment to contribution and spending limits.<BR>  The contribution and voluntary spending limits will be adjusted for inflation beginning in 2007, and every four years thereafter. Current law requires that contribution limits be increased by ten percent beginning January 1, 2003, and every four years thereafter.<BR>  <BR>  Unexpended campaign contributions.<BR>  Current law lists the permissible uses for unexpended   campaign contributions for candidates. This proposal further regulates these contributions by requiring that any money carried forward for use in the next election be counted as a contribution from a political party.<BR>  <BR>  Regulation of political advertisements.<BR>  This proposal regulates two types of political advertisements. The first are those that are made outside the control of a candidate and that specifically urge the election or defeat of a candidate. The proposal requires reporting of the amount of money spent on the advertisement, the type of advertisement, and the name of the candidate being supported or opposed whenever more than $1,000 is spent. Further, when any money is spent on advertising during the 30 days before an election, the report must be made within 48 hours.<BR>  <BR>  Information about who is paying for the advertisement and a statement that it is not authorized by any candidate must appear in these types of political advertisements. Current law, which requires reporting of all expenditures in excess of $1,000 within 24 hours and requires certain disclosure in political advertisements, was struck down by the federal district court.<BR>  <BR>  The second type of political advertisement is one that clearly refers to a candidate without specifically urging the election or defeat of the candidate. These advertisements are regulated during the 30 days before a primary election and the 60 days before a general election. Any individual or organization who spends over $1,000 must report the name and address of any donor who gives more   than $250 to fund the advertisement. When the donor is an individual, the reports must also contain the individual's occupation and the name of the individual's employer.   Current law does not regulate this type of political advertising.<BR>  <BR>  Corporations and labor unions are not allowed to directly fund the two types of political advertisements regulated under this proposal.<BR>  <BR>  Reporting.<BR>  The proposal extends current reporting requirements to small donor committees and requires any person who contributes over $100 to a candidate, political committee, issue committee, or political party to disclose his or her occupation and employer.<BR>  <BR>  Penalties.<BR>  Under this proposal, violating contribution or voluntary spending limits results in a civil penalty of at least double, and up to five times the amount contributed, received, or spent over the allowable amount. Current law makes violations of campaign finance provisions a class 2   misdemeanor; violations of contribution limits are subject to a civil penalty of double the amount contributed or received.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 27,Initiative,Ethics/Lobbying/Campaign Finance,General,0.653,,1

He was born near Yuma, Arizona, on March 31, 1927, and died in 1993. After eighth grade, he left school and worked full time as a migrant farm worker to help support his family. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. During the 1950s, he was an organizer in the Community Service Organization, a civil rights group. Later, he founded the organization now known as the United Farm Workers of America.<BR>  <BR>  Through peaceful strikes and boycotts, his efforts resulted in agricultural labor reforms such as safe and sanitary working conditions, higher wages, and medical coverage. After his death, Cesar Chavez was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian honor bestowed by the federal government.<BR>  <BR>  State holidays in Colorado.<BR>  The proposal increases the number of holidays for state employees from ten to eleven starting in 2003. Currently, the state holidays in Colorado are New Year’s Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Washington-Lincoln Day (also known as Presidents’ Day), Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans’ Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Under current Colorado law, March 31st is recognized as an optional holiday in honor of Cesar Chavez. State agencies are required to remain open on that day.<BR>  <BR>  Employees may take the day off with pay if they trade that day and work another weekday holiday in the same budget year, provided the state agency is open.<BR>  <BR>  Recognition of Cesar Chavez.<BR>  Three other states recognize Cesar Chavez. It is a state   holiday in California and an optional holiday in Texas. Arizona recognizes March 31st as Cesar Chavez Day but does not make it a holiday. On the November 2002 ballot, New Mexico voters will consider a constitutional amendment designating the last Friday in March as a state holiday honoring Cesar Chavez. In Colorado, the City and County of Denver designates the last Monday in March as a holiday honoring Cesar Chavez.<BR>  <BR>  School year holidays in Colorado.<BR>  Local boards of education set the holidays for the annual   school calendar around the minimum hours of state-required school days.

505,Colorado,2002,Coroner Qualifications,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Constitution permits the legislature to establish qualifications for the office of county coroner, including training and certification requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  To run for county coroner, a person must be a U.S. citizen, at least eighteen years old, and a resident of the county for one year prior to an election. These qualifications are outlined in the state constitution. Based on a 1994 ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, the legislature must have   constitutional authority to impose any additional qualifications on the office of county coroner. This proposal allows the legislature to establish qualifications for county coroners, including training and certification requirements. The proposal does not specify the nature or extent of the requirements.<BR>  <BR>  The earliest that any qualifications established by the legislature could apply is the 2006 election. State law requires coroners to determine the cause and manner of death in specific circumstances, including suspicious deaths, unexplained natural deaths, accidents of all types, and suicides. When such a death occurs, coroners must notify the district attorney, take custody of the body, conduct an independent investigation, cause an autopsy to be performed if necessary, and issue a death certificate. In investigating a death, coroners may have to identify the body, collect and document evidence, obtain medical records, perform tests or examinations of the body, notify the next of kin, or conduct an inquest. Coroners may also initiate the process for organ donation in some situations as long as the donation does not interfere with the coroner's investigation.<BR>  <BR>  State law encourages, but does not require, candidates for the office of coroner to possess knowledge and experience in the medical-legal investigation of death. Coroners are also encouraged by state law to participate in programs that provide education and training.

Over 70,000 public school students, or approximately nine percent of Colorado's public school enrollment, qualify as English learners.<BR>  <BR>  Generally, these students receive English language assistance through one of the following types of programs.<BR>   - English as a Second Language: In English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, English learners are taught entirely in English or mainly in English with some native language assistance. Typically, ESL classes include students with different native languages. English learners may attend the ESL program for a part of the day to work strictly on English skills, or attend for a full day and focus both on English and other academic subjects.<BR>  - Bilingual education programs: In bilingual programs, English learners are taught academic subjects in their native language while learning English. Bilingual classes usually have students who share the same native language. The length and content of bilingual programs vary, with some programs emphasizing the development of native language skills more than others.<BR>  - Dual language programs or dual immersion programs: In dual language programs, subjects are taught in two languages in order to develop proficiency in both languages. Students in these programs may be fluent in English or be English learners.<BR>  <BR>  Proposal for English immersion programs.<BR>  The proposal requires school districts to teach English learners in English immersion programs. In these immersion programs, students will be taught English and other academic subjects in English at a level appropriate to their language skills. Generally, the length of time for students to participate in the program is one year, after which time students will begin attending regular classes. School districts may place English learners of different   ages, but with similar English skills, in the same classroom. The proposal's requirements do not apply to foreign language programs or to special education programs.<BR>   <BR>  Parents or legal guardians may request a waiver from the English immersion program for their child. Students who may be eligible for a waiver include: students who already possess adequate English skills, students who are ten years of age or older, and students with special needs. School   officials decide whether to grant or deny the request for the waiver. Schools in which twenty or more students of the same grade level have received a waiver are required to offer a different type of program, such as a bilingual program. In all other cases, students with a waiver may transfer to a school that offers a different type of program of instruction.<BR>  <BR>  Parents or legal guardians of any Colorado public school student may sue for enforcement of the proposal. Additionally, a school district employee or board member may be sued and may be held personally liable for ""willfully and repeatedly"" failing to implement English immersion programs. A final enforcement provision concerns parents of children with special needs. Parents who receive a waiver for their child with special needs have a ten-year window during which they may sue school officials for issuing the waiver, if the parents conclude that the waiver injured the education of their child.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 31,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.446,,0
508,Colorado,2002,Exempt District Attorneys from Term Limits,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Constitution eliminates term limits for elected district attorneys.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Term limits. Colorado has term limits for elected state and local officials. The Colorado Constitution limits the length of office for the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, and attorney general to two consecutive four-year terms. Members of the Colorado legislature may serve up to four consecutive two-year terms in the House of Representatives and two consecutive four-year terms in the Senate. Members of the State Board of Education and the University of Colorado Board of Regents are limited to two consecutive six-year terms.<BR>  <BR>  The maximum term of office for local elected officials is two consecutive terms. Although not expressly stated in the Constitution, the Colorado Attorney General interprets the limits on terms of local elected officials to also apply to elected district attorneys. The Colorado Constitution allows the voters of a political subdivision to eliminate or change the term limits for a local official. However, the Colorado Secretary of State determined that only the state legislature can put a proposal before the voters of a   judicial district to alter term limits for that district. District attorney term limits can also be altered through   a constitutional amendment. This proposal amends the Constitution to repeal term limits for district attorneys.<BR>  <BR>  District attorneys. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts. The voters in each judicial district elect one district attorney who is responsible for the prosecution of criminal cases in that district. The district attorney determines which crimes to prosecute and recommends a penalty to the court. The district attorney also provides legal advice to police officers, assists in preparing search warrants, advises grand jury investigations, and may defend the counties of the district in court. In addition, the district attorney oversees an office of deputy district attorneys and support staff and prepares and administers a   budget for the office. The Colorado Constitution requires a district attorney to be a licensed attorney for at least five years prior to being elected and to be a resident of the district throughout his or her term in office. A district attorney's term of office is four years.",Referendum A,Legislative Referendum,Local Government,General,0.33899999999999997,,0
509,Colorado,2002,Mail Ballot Elections,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Revised Statutes:<BR>  - requires most elections held after January 1, 2005, to be conducted by mail ballot;<BR>  - allows local election officials to determine the method of voting in elections that do not require mail ballots;<BR>  - requires all mail ballots to be returned in a signed envelope either by mail, at drop-off sites, or at designated polling places on election day;<BR>  - adds new security and other requirements for conducting elections by mail and for checking ballots before votes are counted; and<BR>  - increases the penalties for mail-ballot election fraud and other offenses.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Current law allows mail ballots to be used in some elections but not others. Mail ballots cannot be used in any election involving political party candidates, such as a primary, general, or congressional vacancy elections, or any election held on the same day as these elections. Mail ballots are allowed for any other election, such as school district, municipal, or ballot issue elections. Current law also allows voters in any election to vote by mail using an absentee ballot. This proposal expands the use of mail ballots to require that all elections, except certain local elections, be held by mail ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Mail ballot elections under current law.<BR>  Currently, when an election is conducted by mail, each active registered voter is sent a packet of election materials 15 to 25 days before election day. This packet contains a ballot, instructions for completing the ballot, an envelope to maintain secrecy, and a return envelope. A voter must complete the ballot, place it in the secrecy envelope, sign the return envelope, and send the packet back to the election official in the return envelope. A ballot must be received by an election official before 7 p.m. on election day to be counted. Before opening the packet, an election official checks that the signature on the envelope matches the printed name on the envelope. If the names match and the ballot is otherwise qualified, it is ready to be counted.<BR>  <BR>  The Secretary of State is responsible for overseeing mail ballot elections, which are conducted by local election officials. Proposed changes for mail ballot elections. This proposal requires local election officials to develop new procedures for conducting mail ballot elections including updating voter registration rolls and ensuring ballot confidentiality and security. Beginning in 2005, the proposal requires election judges to compare the signature on the ballot envelope against the voter's signature on file with the election official. Signatures that do not match must be reviewed by two other election judges from different political parties. If an election law appears to have been violated, the judges are required to submit questionable signatures to the district attorney. The proposal increases the maximum fine for falsely submitting a ballot or unduly influencing a voter from $5,000 to $10,000.<BR>  <BR>  Current law and polling booth voting.<BR>  Current law requires that elections involving political  party candidates be held at polling places in each precinct. The location of each polling place is designated by the election official. Polling places generally include schools, community centers, churches, and other public buildings. At the polling place, an individual's name must appear in the precinct polling book before he or she is escorted to a private voting booth to cast a secret ballot.<BR>   <BR>  Proposed changes for polling booth voting.<BR>  For elections involving political party candidates, the proposal requires election officials to maintain polling booth locations on election day at public high schools prior to 2010. Beginning in 2010, election officials must maintain at least one polling location on election day. Voters may use private voting booths at these locations to cast the ballot received in the mail or a replacement ballot. The proposal requires election judges to be   present at each location. Ballots cast at polling places are enclosed in a secrecy envelope and a signed return envelope, just like ballots returned by mail or at a drop-off site.<BR>  [S]",Amendment 28,Initiative,Elections,General,0.415,,0
510,Colorado,2002,Public Ownership of Health Facilities,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Constitution:<BR>  - allows local governments, such as special districts, counties, and cities, to jointly own health care services or facilities with private companies or individuals;<BR>  - provides that a local government's and private company's share of ownership in such services or facilities be based on the amount invested;<BR>  - prohibits local governments from going into debt or pledging credit to create and operate health care partnerships; and<BR>  - prevents a partnership created to provide a health care service from being considered a local government or public body.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Local government health care services are provided primarily through county and special district hospitals and local health departments. Hospitals operated by local governments provide a range of health care services that are determined by a hospital board and applicable laws. The   hospital board is either appointed by county commissioners or elected by the voters. Health departments carry out health programs and control disease. The proposal applies to these services and any other health care services provided by a local government.<BR>  <BR>  In providing health care services, local governments can contract with each other or with private companies or individuals. Local governments can also jointly own health care services or facilities with other government bodies. However, local government health care services and facilities currently cannot be provided through joint ownership or partnership with private companies or individuals. If adopted, this proposal would be the second exemption to the constitutional prohibition on partnerships between local governments and private companies.

511,Colorado,2002,Repeal of Obsolete Constitutional Provisions,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Constitution:<BR>  - removes expired provisions for events that have already occurred;<BR>  - strikes an obsolete reference to legislative authority relating to courts; and<BR>  - removes a provision found unconstitutional by the Colorado Supreme Court.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  Expired provisions. The proposal removes four provisions related to the establishment of a statewide court system and judicial reform:<BR>  - a requirement that judges for the then newly created Denver juvenile and probate courts be elected at the 1964 General Election;<BR>  - a provision transferring cases from county courts to district courts, when district courts became courts of general jurisdiction effective January 1965;<BR>  - a provision that allows sitting judges in January 1967 to serve the remainder of their terms during the transition from elected to appointed judges; and<BR>  - language terminating the terms of office for sitting members of the Commission on Judicial Qualifications on July 1, 1983, when it was replaced by the Commission on   Judicial Discipline.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal removes two provisions relating to debt that has since been repaid:<BR>  - a reference to a 1991 state loan to the Limited Gaming Fund for the initial organizational and administrative expenses to establish gaming in Colorado; and<BR>  - a provision regarding the use of lottery proceeds collected from April 1, 1993, to June 30, 1998, for various capital construction projects that have been completed.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal removes additional miscellaneous provisions:<BR>  - a 1902 provision regarding temporary officers for the newly established City and County of Denver; and<BR>  - provisions regarding annexation by Denver, Lakewood, or Aurora permitted between April 1, 1974, and December 20, 1974.<BR>  <BR>  Obsolete reference to legislative authority. The proposal removes language from 1962 granting the state legislature the authority to provide simplified procedures in county courts for claims not exceeding $500. In 1964 and 1976, the state legislature passed laws directing the Judicial Branch to adopt procedures for these courts. The Supreme Court currently provides procedures for all claims filed in   county courts and small claims courts.<BR>  <BR>  Unconstitutional provision. The proposal removes a term-limits provision ruled unconstitutional by the Colorado Supreme Court in 1998. The provision directs state and congressional legislators to follow specific steps to amend the federal constitution to implement congressional term limits, and directs the state to note on the ballot which legislators failed to comply. The court found the provision violates the U.S. Constitution because it takes away the ability of state and congressional legislators to use their own judgment and, in effect, forces them to vote in a particular way.",Referendum D,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.7070000000000001,,1
512,Colorado,2002,Selecting Candidates for Primary Elections,"The proposed amendment to the Colorado Revised Statutes:<BR>  - eliminates the role of caucus and assembly meetings in selecting candidates for the primary ballot;<BR>  - requires all major political party candidates to obtain a minimum number of petition signatures to appear on the primary ballot;<BR>  - changes the number of petition signatures required to qualify for the ballot for all but two political offices and expands the time allowed for collecting signatures;<BR>  - allows a candidate to include a 100-word personal statement on his or her petition; and<BR>  - modifies the procedure for challenging and resolving conflicts about petition signatures.<BR>  <BR>  Background<BR>  <BR>  State law sets forth the process for major political parties (currently the Democratic and Republican parties) to select candidates for the primary ballot. At a primary election, registered Democrats and Republicans vote for candidates to represent their party at the general election in November. To get on the ballot, candidates must either obtain votes cast at assembly meetings or collect petition signatures from voters affiliated with their party. This proposal eliminates the option of obtaining votes at assemblies and requires all candidates to collect petition signatures to get on the primary ballot.<BR>  <BR>  The caucus and assembly process.<BR>  Under current law, caucus meetings are organized within each local election precinct to discuss political candidates and issues. To participate in a precinct caucus, a person must be registered to vote and must be affiliated with a major political party. At each neighborhood caucus, delegates are elected to attend an assembly. At an assembly, delegates vote to select the party's candidates for county, legislative, congressional, or statewide races.   Candidates who receive at least 30 percent of the delegate votes cast at their assembly appear on the primary ballot. Most candidates are placed on the primary ballot through the caucus and assembly process.<BR>  <BR>  Petitioning.<BR>  Currently, a candidate may choose to bypass the caucus and assembly process and collect petition signatures in order to appear on the primary ballot. The option to collect   signatures also presently exists for any candidate who receives between 10 and 30 percent of the votes cast at the assembly. Any candidate who receives less than 10 percent of the vote at an assembly cannot be on the primary ballot.<BR>   <BR>  Signature requirements.<BR>  The proposal changes the number of signatures required to get on the primary ballot for most political offices, in most cases reducing the number from current law.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal extends the time allowed for collecting signatures from roughly two months to roughly six months. Under current law, candidates may begin collecting signatures on the first Monday in April. This proposal allows candidates to begin collecting signatures as early as November 15 of the year before the election. The proposal also requires that signatures be submitted earlier in the year. Current law requires signatures to be submitted 70 days before the August primary election; this proposal requires signatures to be submitted 95 days before the primary. An election official has seven days to review the petitions and notify the candidate whether the petition appears to be sufficient. A person protesting the election official's decision must identify specific names being challenged and the basis for challenging those names.

Under this law, a property owner may sue the responsible construction professional after giving notice and providing an opportunity to fix the defect.  Construction professionals include architects, contractors, developers, and others involved in the construction business.

In addition, if the owner can show that the construction professional committed fraud, he or she may be awarded up to an additional $250,000. Damage awards may also include the costs associated with moving, interest, or legal fees. Under this law, a lawsuit must be filed within two years from the date of discovering the defect or six years from the date the construction occurred.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal.<BR>  This proposal creates a new section in the state constitution that affects current law.

Colorado utilities are not required to use renewable energy sources to generate electricity; however, roughly 2 percent of electricity currently generated in Colorado comes from the renewable energy sources defined in this proposal. To date, 16 other states have adopted renewable energy requirements. The maximum amount and source of the renewable energy vary by state,   ranging from 1.1 percent of the total electricity generated in Arizona (mostly solar) to 30 percent in Maine (mostly hydroelectric).<BR>  <BR>  The proposal requires Colorado utilities with 40,000 or more customers to generate or purchase a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources according to the following schedule:<BR>  - 3 percent from 2007 through 2010;<BR>  - 6 percent from 2011 through 2014; and<BR>  - 10 percent by 2015 and thereafter.<BR>  <BR>  Of the electricity generated each year from renewable sources, at least 4 percent must come from solar technologies.

Under this system, each state is allotted electoral votes equal to the number of the state's representatives and senators in the U.S. Congress.  The electoral college currently consists of 538 electors from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Colorado has nine of these electors. In all but two states, the candidate who gets the most votes receives all of the state's electoral votes. A candidate must receive at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. If no candidate obtains a majority of electoral votes, the presidency is decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state allotted one vote.<BR>  <BR>  In Colorado, each political party designates nine electors. Electors pledge to support that party's candidate for president and vice president. After each presidential election, electors from the winning party meet at the State capitol to cast their vote for president and for vice president.

This proposal makes a number of changes to the constitution and in certain instances gives the legislature the authority to change the personnel system.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, there are about 31,000 state employees in the state personnel system. Most are employees of the state's 19 departments, and some are employees of state higher education institutions. About 29,000 additional state employees are exempt from the state personnel system, including department heads, faculty of public universities, and employees of the legislature, the Governor's Office, and the state courts.

The federal tax rate on cigarettes is 39 cents per pack. State tax rates range from a low of 19 cents per pack in Kentucky to a high of $2.38 per pack in New Jersey. The national average is 91 cents per pack. Colorado's cigarette tax rate is 20 cents per pack.<BR>  <BR>  Tobacco products taxes.<BR>  Taxes on non-cigarette tobacco products are levied on   cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, and chewing tobacco by the federal government and 47 states. The federal government levies its tax according to weight. States tax tobacco products based either on weight or a percentage of price. The tobacco products tax rate in Colorado is 20 percent of the price.<BR>  <BR>  History of tobacco taxes in Colorado.<BR>  In 1964, the state established a tax on cigarettes of 3 cents per pack. Prior to the state cigarette tax and through 1972, many local governments also taxed cigarettes. In 1973, the state raised the tax on cigarettes to 10 cents per pack and gave local governments the option of receiving a portion of state cigarette taxes or levying their own tax. No local government has levied a tax since that time. In 1986, Colorado's cigarette tax was raised to its current rate of 20 cents per pack, and the tobacco products tax of 20 percent of the price was enacted. The proposal prohibits the legislature from reducing these taxes in the future.<BR>  <BR>  Current tobacco tax revenues.<BR>  Colorado collected about $64.8 million from cigarette and tobacco products taxes last year. About one-quarter of this amount is sent to local governments statewide to use as they see fit. The remaining three-quarters is deposited into the state's bank account, along with other state taxes, to pay for state programs.<BR>  <BR>  Current state health-related programs.<BR>  In the current budget year, the state will spend about $3.0 billion to provide health care to low-income individuals, $4.3 million for programs on the dangers of tobacco use, and $141.2 million for a variety of prevention programs run by the state health department.<BR>  <BR>  Distribution of tobacco tax revenues under the proposal.<BR>  Collection of the new tobacco taxes would begin on January 1, 2005. The proposal is expected to raise an additional $175 million annually.

524,Colorado,2006,Colorado Minimum Wage,"Amendment 42 proposes a change to Article XVIII of the Colorado Constitution that:<BR>  - raises the minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $6.85 per hour, and adjusts the wage annually for inflation; and<BR>  - increases the minimum wage for workers who regularly receive tips from $2.13 per hour to $3.83 per hour and adjusts it annually by the same dollar amount as the minimum wage for non-tipped workers.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  What is the minimum wage? The minimum wage is the lowest wage that can be paid to most workers. It was instituted in 1938 by the federal government. Since then, the federal minimum wage has been increased nineteen times, from $0.25 to its current level of $5.15 per hour for most workers and $2.13 per hour for workers that receive tips. It was last increased in 1997.<BR>  <BR>  States can set a higher minimum wage than the federal one. Colorado's minimum wage is currently set at the federal amount of $5.15 per hour. Although federal law also allows cities to enact a higher minimum wage, state law does not allow cities to enact minimum wage laws separate from that of the state.<BR>  <BR>  Which workers typically get paid the minimum wage? Nationally, nearly three-quarters of those paid $5.15 per hour or less work in service jobs, mostly in food preparation and serving. Some workers can be paid less than $5.15 per hour because they receive tips or other compensation in addition to their hourly wage. Also, there are several jobs that are not covered by the minimum wage. The most common of these include certain farm workers, part-time babysitters, some seasonal and recreational employees, newspaper delivery persons, and salespeople who regularly work away from their employer's place of business.<BR>  <BR>  The federal government publishes wage data for workers paid by the hour. This data overstates the number of workers affected by Amendment 42 because it includes workers not covered by minimum wage laws. Also, it understates the earnings of some workers because it does not include tips and other compensation. According to 2005 wage data, about 106,000, or just under 5 percent, of Colorado workers were paid less than $6.85 per hour, the wage rate set in Amendment 42. About 72,000 of these workers were paid between $5.15 and $6.85 per hour, 9,000 were paid $5.15 per hour, and 25,000 were paid less than $5.15 per hour. Many of the workers earning below $5.15 per hour likely received other compensation that pushed their total earnings above $5.15 per hour.<BR>  <BR>  How does Amendment 42 change state law? Amendment 42 increases Colorado's minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $6.85 per hour beginning January 1, 2007. Furthermore, the proposal adjusts the wage by the rate of inflation each year. For workers who regularly receive tips, the minimum wage increases from $2.13 per hour to $3.83 per hour. This wage will adjust each year so that it will always be no more than $3.02 less than that for workers who do not receive tips. For example, if inflation is 3 percent in 2007, in 2008 the minimum wage would increase to $7.06 for most workers and $4.04 for workers who receive tips.<BR>  <BR>  How many states have higher minimum wages than the federal one? As of August 2006, 23 states and the District of Columbia had adopted a minimum wage greater than the federal minimum wage. Of those, four are adjusted annually by the rate of inflation. Washington State has the highest minimum wage. It is currently set at $7.63 per hour and adjusts for inflation each year.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  State spending and revenue. Students employed in work-study positions at state universities and colleges are often paid less than $6.85 per hour. The difference between current student wages and the wages required by Amendment 42 could cost the state up to $2.8 million annually. The actual state cost will depend on the options used by the legislature or schools to address the higher wages, such as providing more state money to the schools, increasing fees or tuition, or reducing the number of work study hours available to students. All other state employees are currently paid above $6.85 per hour.<BR>  <BR>  Presently, it is unknown whether the amendment will affect state revenue from income or sales tax collections. Any change in tax revenue cannot be quantified at this time.<BR>  <BR>  Local government impact. The fiscal impact of the amendment on local government has not been estimated, though expenditures would increase for those local governments that currently pay workers at or near the minimum wage. Any change in local tax revenue cannot be quantified at this time.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 42,Initiative,Labor & Employment,General,0.5329999999999999,,1
525,Colorado,2006,Domestic Partnerships,"Referendum I proposes a change to the Colorado statutes that:<BR>  - creates a new legal relationship, called a domestic partnership, providing same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the legal protections and responsibilities granted to married couples by Colorado law;<BR>  - defines the criteria and process for entering into a domestic partnership; and<BR>  - specifies that domestic partnerships are not marriage and do not change the public policy of the state, which defines marriage as only the union of one man and one woman.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Under Colorado law, there is no process for same-sex couples to establish a legally binding relationship with legal protections, benefits, and responsibilities. Referendum I creates such a process, beginning February 12, 2007, and gives domestic partners the legal rights and responsibilities that spouses have. The legislature is required to pass laws to implement the provisions of Referendum I.<BR>  <BR>  Domestic partnerships under Referendum I. Referendum I provides domestic partners legal rights, responsibilities, and benefits, including:<BR>  - jointly holding property with rights of inheritance;<BR>  - jointly incurring and being liable for debt;<BR>  - covering a partner as a dependent under policies for life insurance and health care;<BR>  - family leave benefits;<BR>  - committing a partner to a mental health facility;<BR>  - protection under the state's domestic violence laws; and<BR>  - disposing of a deceased partner's last remains.<BR>  <BR>  Under Referendum I, Colorado laws that apply to spouses also apply to domestic partners, including laws that:<BR>  - pertain to medical care decisions, hospital visitation, and terminal care documents;<BR>  - grant workers' compensation payments to spouses and dependents;<BR>  - allow civil lawsuits based on spousal status, such as lawsuits for wrongful death;<BR>  - prohibit discrimination based on spousal status in areas such as housing and employment; and<BR>  - govern legal separation, divorce, property division, spousal maintenance, and child custody and support.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, same-sex couples may sign legal documents for some protections and benefits, including the right to make medical decisions and to jointly hold and to inherit property. Other rights, such as filing suit for wrongful death, accessing a partner's workers' compensation benefits, or collecting child support, can only be granted by law. Therefore, they are not currently available to same-sex couples.<BR>  <BR>  Referendum I specifically prohibits domestic partners from filing a joint state income tax return. Additionally, it permits a child placement agency to refuse to place a child with domestic partners for adoption if the agency objects on religious grounds.<BR>  <BR>  Creating domestic partnerships. Individuals entering into a domestic partnership must be at least eighteen years of age and of the same sex. Individuals cannot enter into a domestic partnership with an ancestor, descendant, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew, or a person who is married or in another domestic partnership.<BR>  <BR>  Parties to a domestic partnership are required to obtain a license. The license may be certified by an individual such as a judge or member of the clergy, or the parties may certify the partnership themselves. The domestic partnership is then registered with the state.<BR>  <BR>  Recognition of domestic partnerships. Federal law allows each state to determine whether it recognizes a legal relationship between same-sex couples established in another state. Under Referendum I, only domestic partnerships that are registered in Colorado are valid in Colorado. Other states will determine whether to recognize domestic partnerships registered in Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  The federal government uses marital status as the qualification for a number of federally regulated rights and responsibilities. Examples include the ability to jointly file federal taxes, receive Social Security survivor and disability benefits, and obtain work and residency visas for foreign spouses. Referendum I does not extend any of these federal rights and responsibilities to domestic partners in Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  State revenues and expenditures. The state will charge $17 for domestic partnership certificates resulting in new state revenues of $59,500 per year, based on an estimated 3,500 certificates annually. Annual state expenditures of $136,000 are expected to review and process civil rights complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of employment, housing, and public accommodation. These costs do not include spending associated with legal challenges that may result from Referendum I or from potential changes in the number and complexity of other court cases involving same-sex couples.<BR>  <BR>  County revenues and expenditures. Counties are required to collect a $7 license fee for each domestic partnership to offset their costs. Thus, $24,500 in license fee revenue is expected to be retained by counties each year.<BR>  [S]",Referendum I,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.47700000000000004,,0
526,Colorado,2006,Ethics in Government,"Amendment 41 proposes to add a new Article XXIX to the Colorado Constitution that:<BR>  - prohibits elected state officials and certain elected local officials, appointed state and local officials, and government employees from accepting any amount of money or more than $50 in gifts in any calendar year from anyone except a relative or a personal friend on a special occasion;<BR>  - prohibits immediate family members of elected state officials and certain elected local officials, appointed state and local officials, and government employees from accepting more than $50 worth of gifts or other things of value in any calendar year that directly or indirectly benefit the public official or government employee;<BR>  - bans lobbyists from giving gifts or meals to any elected state official and certain elected local officials, appointed state and local officials, and government employees or to the immediate family members of these public officials and employees;<BR>  - prohibits statewide elected officeholders and state legislators from lobbying certain elected state officials for pay for two years after leaving office; and<BR>  - creates a five-member appointed ethics commission, with individual members having subpoena power, to investigate and hear state and local complaints, assess penalties, and advise government officials and employees when asked regarding the scope of the law.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Acceptance of gifts by public officials. Current law prohibits an elected state official from accepting the following gifts in connection with the person's public service:<BR>  - any money; or<BR>  - any equipment, supplies, or services worth more than $50, such as a fax machine, an office computer, a newspaper   subscription, or donated office space.<BR>  Other gifts are allowed, but some must be reported quarterly to the Secretary of State. The 30 prohibitions and reporting requirements apply to the following elected state officials, as well as candidates for these offices:  governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer, state legislators, district attorneys, members of the State Board of Education, and regents of the University of Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 41 expands the current prohibitions to cover other gifts and things of value, such as favors or services, travel, meals, entertainment, and honoraria, as well as promises of future employment. Amendment 41 also extends the ban to apply to heads of departments of state government, salaried members of state boards and commissions, county and municipal officials, and most government employees, including independent contractors.<BR>  <BR>  Gifts from lobbyists and lobbying by former elected state officials.  Amendment 41 prohibits professional lobbyists from giving gifts of any kind, including meals, to public officials and government employees or their family members. It also prohibits statewide elected officeholders and state legislators from lobbying professionally for two years after leaving office. This restriction applies only to lobbying a state legislator or a statewide elected officeholder. Professional lobbying is when a person is paid to advocate an interest or position to policymakers.<BR>  <BR>  Ethics commission. Under current law, public officials and government employees are subject to a code of ethics. Ethics complaints against statewide elected officeholders, governor appointees, and employees of state departments are reviewed by a board of ethics upon request of the governor. Complaints filed against legislators are heard by a committee made up of legislators at the discretion of legislative leadership. Many local governments also have procedures in place to handle ethics complaints.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 41 creates an ethics commission with jurisdiction over all state, county, and municipal officials and employees. The commission's purpose is to hear complaints, issue findings, assess penalties, and issue advisory opinions. Any person can file a complaint with the commission alleging a violation of the proposal, or any other standard of conduct or reporting requirement specified in law. The commission must investigate the complaint, hold a public hearing, and issue findings, unless the complaint is found to be frivolous. The commission has the power to subpoena documents or witnesses. It can also assess penalties if it finds an ethics violation occurred. In addition to investigating complaints, the commission can issue advisory opinions in response to a written request from a public official or government employee.<BR>  <BR>  The commission consists of five people. The state senate, the state house of representatives, the governor, and the chief justice of the Colorado Supreme Court each appoint one person to the commission. The fifth person is a local government official or local government employee selected by the other members. No more than two members may be from the same political party, and members must have been continuously registered with the same political party, or continuously unaffiliated, for at least two years before their appointment. Amendment 41 is silent on holding individual commission members accountable for any malfeasance committed while acting in their official capacity as members of the independent ethics commission.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 41 is expected to increase state government expenditures and state, county, and municipal government revenues. The increase in expenditures will depend upon the number of staff employed by the ethics commission and the cost of office space and supplies. Staff will be needed to investigate complaints, advise the commission, and prepare subpoenas. State revenues will increase to the extent that public officials and employees are fined for ethics violations. Most existing ethics laws and standards are similar to this proposal. As such, any state or local government revenue from fines is anticipated to be minimal.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 41,Initiative,Ethics/Lobbying/Campaign Finance,General,0.626,,1
527,Colorado,2006,Immigration Lawsuit Against Federal Government,"Referendum K proposes a change to the Colorado statutes that:<BR>  - requires the state of Colorado to sue the federal government to demand enforcement of existing federal immigration laws.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Federal immigration law determines which foreign-born individuals may enter the country, establishes procedures to become a U.S. citizen, and specifies how these laws are enforced. States cannot impose penalties for violations of federal immigration laws. States can adopt some laws related to immigration, for instance, some states, including Colorado, have laws prohibiting the expenditure of tax dollars to provide certain government services to illegal immigrants.<BR>  <BR>  Referendum K directs the Colorado attorney general to initiate, or join other states in, a lawsuit against the U.S. attorney general to demand that the federal government enforce existing federal immigration laws. These attorneys general are the main legal advisors and law enforcement officers of the state of Colorado and the United States, respectively.<BR>  <BR>  Several states have unsuccessfully sued the federal government to demand enforcement of immigration laws and to recover costs related to the education, incarceration, and health care of illegal immigrants, arguing that the costs result from the federal government's failure to enforce its laws. The Colorado legislature recently passed two laws that direct the state attorney general to take all available steps to make the federal government pay state costs related to illegal immigration. These steps could include suing the federal government.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Referendum K is expected to cost the state $190,000 annually until the lawsuit is resolved.

528,Colorado,2006,Limiting a State Business Tax Income Deduction,"Referendum H proposes a change to the Colorado statutes that:<BR>  - increases state income taxes owed for some businesses that deduct wages or other compensation paid to unauthorized aliens; and<BR>  - defines an unauthorized alien as a person who is not eligible under federal immigration law to work in the United States.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  How do business income taxes work? Like individuals, businesses pay taxes based on the amount of income they earn. In determining the amount of income on which federal taxes are owed, federal law allows businesses to deduct all expenses that are considered ordinary and necessary in conducting business, including wages. These deductions lower the amount of federal taxes owed. Federal law does not specifically exclude wages paid to unauthorized aliens from a business' income tax deductions. State income taxes are based on federal taxable income. Therefore, any deductions claimed on the federal form also lower the amount of state income taxes owed.<BR>  <BR>  How does Referendum H affect state income taxes? Beginning January 1, 2008, Referendum H requires a business to disclose the amount of wages or other compensation paid to unauthorized aliens that it deducted as an expense on its federal income tax return. Referendum H increases the business' state taxable income by this amount, which results in a higher state income tax bill. This requirement applies only to annual wages or other compensation paid of $600 or more per worker. Furthermore, the requirement applies only in cases where the business knew at the time of hiring that it was hiring an unauthorized alien.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Referendum H may increase state income tax collections. Increased tax collections are expected to be minimal because Referendum H does not apply in a variety of circumstances, such as wages paid in cash or employment gained using fraudulent documents, and compliance is expected to be inconsistent. If the state collects more than $150,000 in any budget year as a result of Referendum H, the state is required to refund the excess amount back to taxpayers. A small expenditure for the Department of Revenue will be necessary for computer programming in order to add a line on the state income tax form.<BR>  [S]",Referendum H,Legislative Referendum,Business & Commerce,General,0.507,,1
529,Colorado,2006,Marijuana Possession,"Amendment 44 proposes a change to the Colorado statutes that:<BR>  - legalizes the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana for adults 21 years of age or older.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Individuals who grow, transfer, possess, sell, or consume marijuana violate federal, state and, in some cases, local laws. Amendment 44 addresses state law for possession only; enforcement of other marijuana laws would not change.<BR>  <BR>  State possession law. Under state law, any person who possesses one ounce or less of marijuana commits a Class 2 petty offense, which is punishable by a fine of up to $100.  State courts convicted 3,700 adults for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in the 2005 state budget year, the most recent data available. This number does not include convictions in municipal courts, which also hear some marijuana possession cases.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 44 allows adults 21 years of age or older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana. Possession would include consumption or use, as long as it does not occur in public. It also would include transferring up to one ounce of marijuana to another individual 15 years of age or older as long as there is no compensation, although possession for those under 21 years of age would remain illegal.<BR>  <BR>  Other marijuana offenses. The following marijuana offenses will continue to be illegal under state law if Amendment 44 passes:<BR>  - for individuals under 21 years of age, possessing any amount of marijuana;<BR>  - possessing more than one ounce of marijuana;<BR>  - for individuals 18 years of age and older, transferring any amount of marijuana to a person under 15 years of age;<BR>  - growing or selling marijuana;<BR>  - open and public display, use, or consumption of marijuana; and<BR>  - driving under the influence of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 44 may reduce state and local government revenues because fines would no longer be assessed for adult marijuana possession of one ounce or less. The amount of the revenue reduction cannot be quantified because the total number of individuals convicted annually for possessing one ounce or less of marijuana is not known.  The state collects data for convictions in state courts but not municipal courts. In addition, judges have discretion when assessing fines, and the maximum fine is not levied against all offenders.

531,Colorado,2006,Obsolete Constitutional Provisions,"Referendum G proposes a change to Articles XVII, XX, and XXIV of the Colorado Constitution that:<BR>  - removes provisions, dates, and references to laws that are obsolete from three sections of the constitution; and<BR>  - eliminates specific gender references in one section of the constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Referendum G addresses three sections of the constitution: militia duty, the consolidation of the City and County of Denver's school districts, and the Old Age Pension Fund.<BR>  <BR>  Militia duty. Referendum G removes a requirement that an individual with a moral objection to militia duty pay a fee to be exempt from duty. Requiring payment for an exemption from military service dates back to the colonial era and generally ended around the Civil War.

In both processes, citizens collect a certain number of signatures on a petition to place a law change on the ballot. For one process, citizens propose a change that becomes law if voters approve it. For the second process, citizens challenge a law approved by elected officials. A challenged law takes effect only if voters approve it.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 38 expands the ability of citizens to propose and challenge laws at all levels of state and local government, including school districts, counties, special districts, authorities, and other special purpose government entities. Amendment 38 also changes existing procedures for placing a measure on the ballot by petition and applies them to all levels of government. Amendment 38 does not affect measures that governing bodies refer to voters. Tables 1 through 3 summarize differences between current procedures and the proposal. While the tables reflect local procedures in state law, procedures may vary under city or town charters or by local ordinance. [NOTE:  To view the tables summarized here, please visit the ballot measures page of the Colorado General Assembly's web site.]<BR>  <BR>  Table 1 - procedures related to ballot titles and petition signatures. Before proponents may begin collecting petition signatures, a ballot title for the measure must be set. A ballot title tells voters how the law will change if the measure passes.

Amendment 38 is expected to increase the number of statewide ballot petitions by two in each even-numbered year and eight in each odd-numbered year. Currently, the state budgets for eight petitions in an even year and two in an odd year. Costs will increase due to a greater number of petitions, and because state courts must review ballot disputes within newly established deadlines. Costs will decrease to approve each petition because signatures will only be counted and not verified. Overall, state spending will increase by $119,000 annually in even-numbered years and $269,000 in odd-numbered years. Amendment 38 also imposes a $3,000 fine for certain offenses related to government officials discussing pending ballot issues, which may increase fine revenue to the state.

533,Colorado,2006,Property Tax Exemption for Disabled Veterans,"Referendum E proposes a change to Section 3.5 of Article X of the Colorado Constitution that:<BR>  - reduces property taxes for qualified disabled veterans by exempting a portion of the value of their home from property taxation; and<BR>  - defines a qualified disabled veteran as a veteran who has a service-connected disability with a 100-percent permanent disability rating.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  How does the program work? Homeowners pay property taxes based on the value of their home and the tax rate set by the local governments where they live. Referendum E reduces the taxable value of a qualified veteran's home by one-half of the first $200,000 of the home's value, thereby lowering property taxes owed on the home. The state legislature can adjust the $200,000 amount to either increase or decrease the benefit from Referendum E in future years. Currently, the state offers the same property tax reduction to homeowners age 65 and over who have lived in their homes for at least ten years. A qualifying veteran who is also eligible for a reduction in property taxes as a senior cannot claim both reductions.<BR>  <BR>  The dollar amount of the tax reduction will vary among homeowners depending upon the local property tax rate, the home's value, and the amount of the exemption. Table 1 provides examples of how Referendum E reduces property taxes based on the average statewide property tax rate and the current exemption level. [NOTE:  To view the tables summarized here, please visit the ballot measures page of the Colorado General Assembly's web site.]<BR>  <BR>  Who qualifies for the tax reduction? Homeowners who have served on active duty in the U. S. Armed Forces and are rated 100-percent permanently disabled by the federal government due to a service-connected disability qualify for the tax reduction in Referendum E. Colorado National Guard members injured while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces also qualify.  Veterans are rated 100-percent   permanently disabled when a mental or physical injury makes it impossible for the average person to hold a job and the disability is lifelong. Nationally, less than one percent of veterans have a 100-percent permanent disability rating. About 2,200 veterans are expected to qualify for the property tax reduction in Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  What are the fiscal implications? Referendum E affects property taxes paid beginning in 2008. The average property tax savings for those who qualify will be about $466. The total reduction in property taxes is estimated to be about $1 million in the first year. The state is required to reimburse local governments for the reduction in property tax revenue resulting from Referendum E.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Referendum E increases state expenditures because it requires the state to reimburse local governments for reduced property tax collections. The state estimates that roughly 2,200 disabled veterans will qualify for the exemption and the average property tax reduction per veteran will be $466. Thus, the impact to the state will be slightly more than $1 million, beginning with the 2008 budget year.<BR>  [CA]",Referendum E,Legislative Referendum,Military & Veterans Affairs,General,0.792,,1
534,Colorado,2006,Recall Deadlines,"Referendum F proposes a change to Section 2 of Article XXI of the Colorado Constitution that:<BR>  - removes deadlines for protesting petitions to recall elected state officials;<BR>  - allows the state legislature to set deadlines for protesting petitions to recall elected state officials; and<BR>  - changes the requirements for when a recall election is held.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  What is a recall election? A recall election lets voters remove and replace an elected official prior to the end of the official's term. Every state and local elected official in Colorado may be recalled. Recall elections occur mostly at the local level. At a recall election, voters are asked if they want to recall the elected official and to choose a candidate to replace the official if the recall election is successful.<BR>  <BR>  Current state recall election process. Recall elections are triggered when the required number of registered voters sign a recall petition. For elected state officials, the required number of signatures is 25 percent of the votes cast for all candidates for that office in the preceding election. Elected state officials include statewide officeholders, such as the governor and the attorney general, and state officials elected from specific districts, such as legislators and district attorneys. Proponents have up to 60 days to gather signatures after a petition form is approved by state election officials. Signatures on petitions can be protested, which results in a hearing by the election official. The date of the recall election depends on when the petition is submitted, taking into account whether a November election in an even-numbered year will occur in the near future.<BR>  <BR>  Proposed recall petition and election deadlines for elected state officials. Referendum F removes most deadlines for recall petitions and protest hearings from the state constitution and allows the state legislature to set these deadlines in statute. During the 2006 legislative session, House Bill 06-1051 was passed concerning recall elections.   It will take effect July 1, 2007, if Referendum F is approved. As it relates to Referendum F, this law extends deadlines for election officials to hear protests of recall petitions and to hold recall elections. Table 1 compares the current recall deadlines with those in Referendum F and the new statute.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Referendum F is not expected to affect state or local government revenues or expenditures.<BR>  [CA]",Referendum F,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.447,,0
535,Colorado,2006,School District Expenditures for Education,"Two ballot proposals establish requirements for school district spending.  Amendment 39 proposes a change to Section 17 of Article IX of the Colorado Constitution. Referendum J, a legislative proposal, proposes a change to state statute.

Under current law, districts have to set aside money for school supplies and books, buildings and insurance, and services for at-risk students. On average, these earmarked purposes accounted for roughly $600 per pupil in school year 2004-05, or nearly 8 percent of school district operating budgets. Both Amendment 39 and Referendum J propose to add a new requirement: that each school district spend at least 65 percent of its operating budget on the items listed in Table 1.  [NOTE:  To view the tables summarized here, please visit the ballot measures page of the Colorado General Assembly's web site.]<BR>  <BR>  In addition to applying the 65-percent requirement to different items, the two proposals define an operating budget differently.

537,Colorado,2006,Term Limits for Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Judges,"Amendment 40 proposes a change to Section 1 of Article VI of the Colorado Constitution that:  - limits the number of terms that Colorado Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges, called appellate court judges, may serve;<BR>  - reduces the term of Supreme Court justices from ten years to four years, and of Court of Appeals judges from eight years to four years;<BR>  - requires appellate court judges who have already served ten years or more to leave their current position in January 2009; and<BR>  - requires appellate court judges who are eligible to serve another term to appear on the November 2008 ballot for retention.<BR>  <BR>  Summary and Analysis<BR>  <BR>  The Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. The Colorado Supreme Court consists of seven justices who serve ten-year terms. The Colorado Court of Appeals consists of nineteen judges who serve eight-year terms. When a vacancy occurs on either of these courts, an appointed commission selects three nominees for consideration by the governor.  The governor then appoints one of the three nominees to fill the vacancy.<BR>  <BR>  What happens after a judge is appointed? After appointment, appellate judges serve an initial two-year term and then stand for retention at the next general election. At a retention election, voters vote to either keep a judge in office or to remove a judge from office. If voters choose to keep the judge in office, he or she serves an additional term before standing for retention again. There is currently no limit on the number of terms a judge can serve, but judges are required to retire at age 72.<BR>  <BR>  How are Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges evaluated? Appellate judges who are standing for retention are evaluated by a state commission on judicial performance. The commission reviews opinions authored by the justice or judge, conducts an interview with the justice or judge, and reviews surveys completed by trial court judges and attorneys. The commission's evaluation includes a recommendation stated as ""retain,"" ""do not retain,"" or ""no opinion."" This evaluation is printed in the ballot information booklet that is mailed to every Colorado voter household before a general election.<BR>  <BR>  How does Amendment 40 change the current system? Amendment 40 limits Supreme Court and Court of Appeals judges to three terms  one initial two-year term plus two four-year terms. Appellate judges who, as of the November 2008 election, have already served ten years will not be eligible to serve another term in their current position.  Judges who are eligible to continue serving will appear on the November 2008 ballot for retention.<BR>  <BR>  Estimate of Fiscal Impact<BR>  <BR>  Based on current terms, at least five of seven Supreme Court justices and seven of nineteen Court of Appeals judges will leave office on January 13, 2009. Replacement justices and judges may need time to receive training in judicial procedure and to review pending cases, which could create a case backlog and increase workload for agencies working in the court system. Any case backlog will depend on the number of appeals filed and the number of cases resolved during the next two years. It is estimated that if additional resources are needed, they will be requested during the annual budget process.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 40,Initiative,Judiciary,General,0.429,,0
538,Colorado,2008,Allowable Government Paycheck Deductions,"Amendment 49 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - prohibit any public employee paycheck deduction, except for:<BR>  -- deductions required by federal law;<BR>  -- tax withholdings;<BR>  -- court-ordered liens and garnishments;<BR>  -- health benefit and other insurance deductions;<BR>  -- deductions for savings, investment, and retirement plans; and<BR>  -- deductions for charitable, religious, educational, and other tax-exempt organizations.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  A paycheck deduction is a specific amount of money withheld from an employee's pay.

Instead, each local government sets its own rules and, in fact, some local governments have adopted limits on paycheck deductions similar to those in Amendment 49.

539,Colorado,2008,Campaign Contributions from Certain Government Contractors,"Amendment 54 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - prohibit certain government contractors from contributing to a political party or candidate for the contract's duration and two years thereafter;<BR>  - prohibit contributors to ballot issue campaigns from entering into certain government contracts relating to the ballot issue;<BR>  - apply the prohibitions on campaign contributions and ballot issue contracts to any contractor with a government contract or contracts that does not use a public and competitive bidding process soliciting at least three bids and with a total value greater than $100,000 in a single year; and<BR>  - apply the prohibitions on campaign contributions and ballot issue contracts to a labor organization holding a collective bargaining agreement with a state or local government.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Government entities purchase goods and services from private-sector vendors for the operation of government. The awarding of state contracts for these goods and services is regulated by state law. Local governments largely determine their own practices.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How are state government contracts awarded?</B></I> State law requires, with few exceptions, that vendors for state contracts be selected through a competitive bidding process. Separate rules govern small and emergency purchases. In some cases, a state agency may determine that only one good or service can reasonably meet the agency's need, and only one vendor can provide the particular good or service. Examples of circumstances when competitive bidding is not used include cases:<BR>  - where equipment, accessories, or replacement parts must be compatible;<BR>  - where a sole supplier's item is needed for trial use or testing; and<BR>  - where public utility services are to be purchased.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How does the measure affect government contractors and labor organizations?</B></I> Amendment 54 prohibits campaign contributions by certain government contractors. The prohibition applies to contractors with a total contract value of greater than $100,000 in a single year where fewer than three bids are solicited. It also covers labor organizations that represent public employees in a collective bargaining agreement.<BR>  <BR>  Contracts covered by Amendment 54 are referred to in the measure as ""sole source contracts"" and include those awarded by the state, cities, counties, school districts, and other special districts. The measure requires the state to publish and maintain a database of every covered government contract issued at every level of government.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How are Amendment 54's prohibitions applied?</B></I> Under the measure, covered government contractors are prohibited from making a campaign contribution themselves, or on behalf of a family member, to any political party or any state or local candidate for the duration of the contract plus two additional years. A contractor includes:<BR>  - the contracting entity's officers, directors, or trustees;<BR>  - any individual who controls at least 10 percent of the shares of or interest in the entity; and<BR>  - in the case of a collective bargaining agreement, a labor organization and any political committees it creates to make campaign contributions.<BR>  <BR>  The measure also prohibits a person who contributes to a ballot issue campaign from entering into a covered government contract relating to the ballot issue.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What penalties exist under Amendment 54?</B></I> Under Amendment 54, individuals who accept contributions from covered government contractors for the benefit of a political party or candidate must pay restitution to the contracting government. Elected or appointed officials may be removed or disqualified from office for knowingly violating Amendment 54. Further, a covered government contractor who intentionally makes a contribution in violation of the measure is barred from holding a covered government contract or public employment for three years. The governor may suspend these penalties during a declared state of emergency.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the scope of state contracts affected by Amendment 54?</B></I> Information is not available on the number of state contracts that meet the criteria in Amendment 54. However, a sample of state contracts indicates that last year about 6 percent of state contracts had a value greater than $100,000 and were not put out for bid. These contracts represented about 5 percent of the total value of state contracts over $100,000.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the scope of local government contracts affected by Amendment 54?</B></I> Information is not available on the number and value of local contracts that meet the criteria in Amendment 54. Some local governments, including the cities of Boulder and Fort Collins, have enacted laws restricting campaign contributions by individuals holding any type of contract with the local government and would integrate Amendment 54's provisions into existing practice. Local governments also enter into collective bargaining agreements. For example, 45 school districts, representing 80 percent of teachers in the state, and four city police departments, representing 33 percent of the state's police officers, are covered under collective bargaining agreements.",Amendment 54,Initiative,Ethics/Lobbying/Campaign Finance,General,0.512,Amendment,1

541,Colorado,2008,Definition of Person,"Amendment 48 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - define the term ""person"" to ""include any human being from the moment of fertilization""; and<BR>  - apply this definition of person to the sections of the Colorado Constitution that protect the natural and essential rights of persons, allow open access to courts for every person, and ensure that no person has his or her life, liberty, or property taken away without due process of law.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  Like the U.S. Constitution, the Colorado Constitution has a bill of rights. The Colorado bill of rights contains the rights and duties of the people of Colorado and outlines the principles of state government. Amendment 48 defines the term ""person"" for sections 3, 6, and 25 of the Colorado bill of rights. These sections concern inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Inalienable rights.</B></I> Section 3 asserts that all persons have natural, essential, and inalienable rights to life, liberty, property, safety, and happiness. These rights include the right to defend against threats to safety, the freedom to make independent decisions, the right to work and obtain economic goods, and the right to survive.    Inalienable rights are fundamental to all humans and are not created by laws and government. The constitution requires that the government protect these rights, although the government is permitted to limit the exercise of rights as necessary for the public welfare.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional provision regarding inalienable rights has been applied by courts, for example, to guarantee the right of an individual to pursue a legitimate trade or business, to acquire property without fear of discrimination, and to travel freely around the state.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Equality of justice.</B></I>  Section 6 requires the courts in Colorado to be open to all persons. If a person's legal rights are violated, this section guarantees that a judicial remedy is available.<BR>  <BR>  Courts have determined that this section applies to a variety of circumstances. For instance, individuals are denied equal access to justice if juries are chosen in a discriminatory manner. Additionally, all persons have the same right to use the courts regardless of their financial resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Due process of law.</B></I>  Section 25 ensures that no person is deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Due process of law requires the government to follow consistent procedures before a person's fundamental rights are taken away.  The courts have determined, for example, that due process requires the government to provide notice and a fair hearing before detaining a person, taking a person's property, or sentencing a person to death.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Definition of the term ""person.""</B></I>  The Colorado bill of rights does not currently contain a definition of person. Amendment 48 defines person to include a human being from the moment of fertilization. The term ""moment of fertilization"" is not defined in Amendment 48. The generally accepted medical definition of fertilization is the union of a male sperm and a female egg.",Amendment 48,Initiative,Abortion,General,0.267,Amendment,0
542,Colorado,2008,Discrimination and Preferential Treatment by Governments,"Amendment 46 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - prohibit Colorado government from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, or public contracting;<BR>  - make exceptions for federal programs, existing court orders or other legally binding agreements, and bona fide qualifications based on sex; and<BR>  - provide the same remedies that are available for violations of existing Colorado anti-discrimination law.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  Discrimination generally means denying access to an individual based on certain characteristics such as race, age, or sex. The term preferential treatment is often used to refer to policies that assist historically disadvantaged groups in order to remedy past and current discrimination or to increase diversity.<BR>  <BR>  The U.S. Constitution protects individuals against unequal treatment by governments based on such characteristics as race and gender. Currently, governments may consider race and gender when choosing among qualified individuals or firms as long as they do so under a narrowly tailored plan to correct discrimination or promote diversity. The use of quotas and point systems, particularly in public college admissions practices, is rarely allowed.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Provisions of Amendment 46.</B></I>  Amendment 46 adds language to the Colorado Constitution that prohibits discrimination or preferential treatment in the areas of public employment, public education, and public contracting on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. The terms ""discrimination"" and ""preferential treatment"" are  not defined in the measure.<BR>  <BR>  There are various government programs and agencies in Colorado that target assistance to a particular race, gender, or ethnicity that may be affected by Amendment 46. Examples of assistance include programs to help individuals obtain financial aid for college, develop professional skills, or start a business. Private organizations and programs are not affected by the measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Exceptions in Amendment 46.</B></I>  Amendment 46 does not affect the following:<BR>  - Action required to receive federal funding. For example, public schools must ensure that girls receive the same access to school athletics programs as boys in order to receive federal funding.<BR>  - Existing court orders and legally binding agreements that provide a remedy for discrimination. The City and County of Denver, for instance, is under a court order that governs hiring practices for police officers to achieve diversity in the workforce.<BR>  - Bona fide qualifications based on sex. In the area of privacy, hiring a female, as opposed to a male, prison guard for the purpose of searching female inmates is an example of a bona fide qualification for public employment based on sex. Amendment 46 expands this exemption to the areas of public education and public contracting.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Remedies for discriminatory practices and preferential treatment.</B></I>  The measure requires that the remedies that exist for Colorado anti-discrimination law be used for violations of Amendment 46. Additionally, the remedies must be the same regardless of the injured party's race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Most remedies that exist today relate to employment law. Examples include paying lost wages, hiring or reinstating employees, and orders to stop discriminatory practices.",Amendment 46,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.49200000000000005,Amendment,0
543,Colorado,2008,Education Funding and TABOR Rebates,"Amendment 59 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - eliminate rebates that taxpayers receive when the state collects more money than it is allowed, and spend the money on preschool through 12th grade (P-12) public education;<BR>  - eliminate the required inflationary increase for P-12 education spending; and<BR>  - set aside money in a new savings account for P-12 education.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the state spending limit and how is it changed?</B></I> A constitutional provision known as TABOR limits the amount of money the state may spend each year.  Any money collected above the limit must be rebated to taxpayers unless voters allow the state to spend it. Current projections do not show any rebates during the next five years. Since the economy grows faster than the limit over time, tax collections will grow beyond the limit and rebates will occur at some point in the future. Beginning in 2011, Amendment 59 permanently eliminates these rebates and instead places that money in the State Education Fund.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What are the required increases for education spending and how are they changed?</B></I> Another constitutional provision known as Amendment 23 requires the state to increase the amount of money it spends on P-12 education. Spending per student must increase by at least inflation each year after 2011. Amendment 59 eliminates this requirement.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the State Education Fund?</B></I> The State Education Fund is an existing state fund that receives and holds money that can be spent only on P-12 education. Under current law, a portion of state income taxes is deposited in the fund. Amendment 59 deposits the money that the state keeps above the TABOR spending limit into the fund, along with other money the legislature may transfer to the fund.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the new savings account for P-12 education?</B></I> Amendment 59 creates a savings account within the State Education Fund. It places ten percent of income tax revenue that is currently deposited in the fund into the savings account until a certain threshold is reached. This money, about $46 million in the first year, may be spent only if two-thirds of the state legislature votes to do so. In years that statewide personal income grows less than 6 percent, the state legislature may spend it with a simple majority vote. In either case, this money may be spent only on P-12 education.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What else does the amendment do?</B></I> In addition to the TABOR spending limit mentioned above, the state has a yearly limit on spending increases for most state programs. Any money the state has above this limit is currently spent on transportation and to build and maintain the state's buildings. Amendment 59 allows the legislature to transfer this money to the State Education Fund as long as certain other transfers for transportation have been made.",Amendment 59,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.455,Amendment,0

Each town may vote to extend the hours of operation of casinos, to add the games of roulette and/or craps, and to increase the amount that can be wagered on any single bet from $5 up to a maximum of $100. The towns may vote on changing any or all of these limits.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Distribution of state gaming money today and under Amendment 50.</B></I>  Casinos pay taxes on income from gaming and also pay various fees and fines. Last year, the state collected $112 million from gaming. After paying to enforce gaming laws, approximately one-quarter of the gaming money goes back to the gaming cities and counties, about one-quarter goes to historic preservation and restoration projects across the state, and half of the revenue is allocated to the state legislature to spend on programs. These programs currently include assistance to local governments for gaming impacts, tourism promotion, economic development programs, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and highway projects.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 50 distributes new money from increased gaming activity differently than existing law. First, the money is used to pay to enforce gaming laws related to any changes in the limits. Second, some of the new money provides annual increases to the programs and local governments that currently get gaming money. The rest is distributed as follows:<BR>  - 78 percent for financial aid and classroom instruction at Colorado community, junior, and district colleges based on each school's number of students;<BR>  - 12 percent to Gilpin and Teller Counties, based on the proportion of the new money raised within each county, to help address the impacts of gaming; and<BR>  - 10 percent to Central City, Black Hawk, and Cripple Creek, based on the proportion of the new money raised within each town, to help address the impacts of gaming.<BR>  <BR>  [Table 1, available on the website of the Colorado General Assembly, but not reproducible here, shows how new state gaming money is distributed under Amendment 50 assuming that all three gaming towns approve the maximum limits.]<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Statewide voter approval for gaming tax increases.</B></I> The state Gaming Commission sets the tax rates on casino income within the parameters in the state constitution. Currently, the constitution sets the highest allowable tax rate at 40 percent. On July 1, 2008, the highest tax rate actually imposed was 20 percent. If voters in any of the gaming towns approve new gaming limits, a gaming tax increase above the July 1, 2008, level must be approved through a statewide vote.",Amendment 50,Initiative,Education: Higher Ed,General,0.586,Amendment,1

547,Colorado,2008,Prohibition on Mandatory Labor Union Membership and Dues,"Amendment 47 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - prohibit requiring an employee to join and pay any dues or fees to a labor union as a condition of employment; and<BR>  - create a misdemeanor penalty for violation of this law.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  Requirements for union membership today. All employees have the right to join a workplace union as a means for negotiating with their employer over issues such as pay, benefits, and working conditions.<BR>  <BR>  The procedure to form a union in the private sector is outlined in federal and Colorado law. The decision to be represented by a union must be approved by a majority vote of the employees. At this point, membership and payment of dues is voluntary. Once a union is in place, private-sector employees in Colorado may vote to include, as part of the collective bargaining process, a requirement that all employees,  including those who choose not to join the union, pay their share of the cost of collective bargaining as a condition of employment.<BR>  <BR>  Neither federal nor Colorado law regulates the formation of unions for most state and local public employees, such as teachers or government workers. In the public sector, the employer decides how to recognize and interact with any prospective union. The collective bargaining agreement sets forth requirements for membership and payment of dues. It can require public employees who choose not to join the union to pay their share of the cost of collective bargaining.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Requirements for union membership under Amendment 47.</B></I> Amendment 47 applies to all employees, whether working in the public or private sector. It eliminates the possibility that any employee can be required to pay for the cost of collective bargaining or join a union as a condition of employment. Violation of this law carries the highest-level misdemeanor fine, which is currently a fine of between $500 and $5,000.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 47 defines a labor union to include organizations that deal with employers over employee issues such as wages, rates of pay, hours of work, grievances, and other conditions of employment, and organizations that provide mutual aid or protection in connection with employment.",Amendment 47,Initiative,Labor & Employment,General,0.444,Amendment,0

549,Colorado,2008,Severance Taxes on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry,"Amendment 58 proposes changing the Colorado statutes to:<BR>  - increase the amount of state severance taxes paid by oil and natural gas companies, primarily by eliminating an existing state tax credit;<BR>  - allocate the increased severance tax revenue to college scholarships for state residents, wildlife habitat, renewable energy projects, transportation projects in energy-impacted areas, and water treatment grants; and<BR>  - exempt all oil and gas severance tax revenue from state and local spending limits.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the severance tax?</B></I> The severance tax is paid by companies that extract nonrenewable natural resources from the earth, including oil and gas, gold, coal, and molybdenum. Over the last five years, 92 percent of state severance tax collections have come from oil and gas, and nearly all of that is from gas. Last year, the state collected $140 million in oil and gas severance taxes. Collections fluctuate annually with changing energy prices.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How does Amendment 58 change Colorado's current severance taxes on oil and gas?</B></I> Amendment 58 eliminates a state tax credit, increases the number of oil and gas wells subject to the tax, and changes the tax rate on oil and gas companies.  These changes are estimated to increase state severance tax collections by $321 million in budget year 2010.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Eliminating the state tax credit.</I> The state currently allows companies to reduce their severance tax payment by 87.5 percent of local property taxes paid on oil and gas production. Amendment 58 removes this tax credit, increasing state severance taxes by an estimated $258 million in budget year 2010.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Increasing the number of wells subject to the tax.</I> Companies currently do not have to pay the severance tax on small wells. Amendment 58 increases the number of smaller wells subject to the tax. With this change, the production on which the tax is paid increases from 40 percent to 56 percent for oil and from 80 percent to 90 percent for gas. This change is expected to increase state severance tax revenue by $62 million in budget year 2010.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Changing the tax rate on oil and gas companies.</I> Colorado currently taxes oil and gas companies at rates between 2 and 5 percent, depending on income. Amendment 58 changes the tax to a flat, 5 percent rate for companies earning $300,000 or more, eliminating taxes for small companies and increasing taxes on large companies. As a result, a company earning more than $300,000 will pay 5 percent on all of its income, while a company earning less than $300,000 will pay no severance tax. The loss in revenue from small companies is expected to be minimal, while the tax increase on large companies is estimated to raise state severance tax collections by about $1 million annually.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How do Colorado's oil and gas taxes compare to other states?</B></I> Colorado's actual severance tax rate is the lowest of the eight large-producing western states when each state's exemptions, deductions, and credits are taken into account. In budget year 2007, Colorado's actual severance tax rate was 1.3 percent; Montana's rate was the highest at 6.8 percent. Assuming the taxes in other states remain the same, Amendment 58 raises Colorado’s severance tax ranking to the third lowest. These rankings do not take into account other taxes that oil and gas companies pay, such as income, sales, and property taxes, which vary among the states.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How is severance tax revenue distributed under current law?</B></I> Under current law, Colorado severance tax revenue is evenly divided between state programs and local governments. The state portion pays for water projects and programs related to mineral extraction, clean energy development, low-income energy assistance, and wildlife conservation. The local government portion is distributed to communities affected by mining, either based on mining activity in the area or through competitive loans or grants.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How does Amendment 58 distribute severance tax revenue?</B></I> Under Amendment 58, the state programs and local governments that currently receive all of the severance tax revenue will evenly split 44 percent of severance tax collections. Although the portion of money set aside for these uses is less than under current law, the estimated increase in collections under Amendment 58 is expected to provide existing programs with about the same amount of money over the next four years. However, severance tax collections fluctuate with energy prices, and state programs and local governments could receive more or less money than currently anticipated.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 58 dedicates the remaining 56 percent of severance tax revenue to new uses. Ten percent is placed in a reserve account for future use by the state. Ninety percent pays for new programs as follows:<BR>  - 60 percent for a college scholarship program for lower- and middle-income Coloradans. The governor-appointed board that oversees the state's higher education system sets the specific eligibility criteria for the scholarship program, considering factors such as income, family size, and academic performance;<BR>  - 15 percent to assist local governments, nonprofit organizations, and the state to acquire and maintain wildlife habitat. The state board tasked with preserving Colorado's wildlife and open space distributes this money;<BR>  - 10 percent for projects that promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable, clean energy resources;<BR>  - 10 percent for transportation projects in areas of the state impacted by the oil and gas industry; and<BR>  - 5 percent for small community drinking water and domestic wastewater treatment projects.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How do Amendment 58 and Amendment 52 interact?</B></I> Both Amendment 58 and Amendment 52 change how the state spends severance tax revenue, but the two measures propose different uses for the money. Thus, some of the provisions of these measures appear to conflict with one another. Should both measures pass, the state will be required to implement these conflicting provisions, but if challenged the courts will have to decide how the measures take effect. Amendment 52 proposes a change to the state constitution, while this measure proposes a change to state statute. To date, Colorado courts have not addressed this type of conflict between ballot measures, but it is likely that the constitutional provision would prevail.",Amendment 58,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.42100000000000004,Statutory,0
550,Colorado,2008,State Sales Tax Increase for Services for People with Developmental Disabilities,"Amendment 51 proposes amending the Colorado statutes to:<BR>  - increase the state sales and use tax from 2.9 percent to 3.0 percent on July 1, 2009, and from 3.0 percent to 3.1 percent on July 1, 2010;<BR>  - direct that the new money be used to pay for services for people with developmental disabilities and to help eliminate the waiting lists for services;<BR>  - prohibit the legislature from reducing the current level of state funding for services for people with developmental disabilities; and<BR>  - exempt the new money from state spending limits.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Developmental disabilities.</B></I> Developmental disabilities include a number of different conditions that affect a person's physical or mental abilities, such as speaking, moving, learning, and independent living. Developmental disabilities can become apparent at anytime up to age 22 and last throughout a person’s lifetime. Mental retardation, autism, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy are examples of developmental disabilities.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Services for people with developmental disabilities.</B></I> Services for people with developmental disabilities are delivered through a state and local system. The state administers the overall system; twenty local nonprofit agencies throughout the state determine a person's eligibility and arrange and provide services. Services are generally provided in the community or in the family home, and vary based upon the person's specific disability and needs. For instance, one person may need assistance with speech and language development, another may need job training to become employed, and another may need full-time care.<BR>  <BR>  Current funding allows about 11,800 people to receive services in the community.  This year, federal, state, and local government funding for services is estimated at $372 million. The state's share of that total is about $184 million.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Waiting lists for services.</B></I> There are currently about 9,700 adults and children on waiting lists for services within the next two years. That number is expected to grow to over 12,000 people by 2012. If funding to eliminate the waiting lists becomes available, a number of people who are not currently on a waiting list may seek services as services become more accessible. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the total number of people who are eligible for services and the cost to eliminate the waiting lists.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Sales and use tax.</B></I> The state sales tax is paid on the purchase price of most items. Some items are exempt, such as food bought at grocery stores, prescription drugs, household electricity and heat, and gasoline. The tax applies to some services, most notably local telephone service, cell phone service, food and drink service at restaurants and bars, and lodging. The state use tax is paid on items on which the sales tax was not collected, such as items bought from sellers outside of the state. In addition to the state, local governments also have sales and use taxes, although they may apply to different items than the state tax.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Amount of tax increase.</B></I> The current state sales and use tax rate is 2.9 percent.  When combined with local government sales taxes, the total tax rate varies across the state. For example, the total tax rate in the City of Denver is 7.72 percent, in Fort Collins it is 6.7 percent, in Fort Morgan it is 5.9 percent, in Pueblo it is 7.4 percent, and it is 7.65 percent in Grand Junction.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 51 raises the state tax rate to 3.1 percent over two years. On July 1, 2009, the rate increases to 3 percent, and on July 1, 2010, and thereafter the rate is 3.1 percent. The measure is estimated to raise about $89 million in the first year of the tax increase and $186 million in the next year when the tax increase is fully in place.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Use of the new money for services.</B></I> Amendment 51 requires that all of the new sales tax money be used for services for people with developmental disabilities to help reduce the current waiting lists. The money cannot be used for state administration costs or to reduce current state spending on services. However, in any year in which two-thirds of the state legislature and the governor declare a state fiscal emergency, the money can be used for any purpose relating to services for people with developmental disabilities, such as replacing the current level of spending on services and for state administration costs. In addition, Amendment 51 creates a reserve for any money that is not spent in a given year for use in future years. Finally, a large portion of the new money can be used to leverage additional federal funds, increasing the total amount available to pay for services.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How Colorado's taxes compare with other states.</B></I> Colorado has the lowest state sales tax rate of the 45 states with a state sales tax. However, Colorado has higher local government sales tax rates than most states. Thus, when comparing combined state and local sales taxes, Colorado ranks higher. Colorado ranks 17th in the amount of sales taxes paid per person and 23rd in the amount paid based on wealth. Colorado's total state and local taxes, including income, property, sales, and other taxes, rank 26th in the amount paid per person and 46th based on wealth.",Amendment 51,Initiative,Human Services,General,0.376,Statutory,0
551,Colorado,2008,Use of Severance Tax Revenue for Highways,"Amendment 52 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - require the state legislature to spend a portion of state severance tax collections on highway projects.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the severance tax?</B></I> Companies that extract nonrenewable natural resources such as coal, oil, natural gas, gold, and silver from the earth pay the state severance tax. The amount of severance tax paid is based on company income or the volume of the resource mined.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How is severance tax revenue spent now?</B></I> The state legislature determines how severance tax revenue is spent. Under existing statutes, it is evenly divided between local governments and state programs. State statute distributes the local government portion to communities impacted by the mineral extraction industry — either directly based on mining activity in the area or through competitive loans or grants. The state portion is spent on loans for local water projects like dams, pipelines, and canals; programs regulating mining activity; and, in recent years, programs like low-income energy assistance and wildlife conservation.<BR>  <BR>  How does Amendment 52 change current law? Of the 50 percent of severance taxes spent on state programs, Amendment 52 constitutionally limits the amount that the state legislature can spend to the prior year's amount plus inflation (with an adjustment if severance tax collections decrease). The remaining amount of the state portion must be used to construct and maintain highways, with priority given to relieving congestion on Interstate-70 (I-70). The state legislature is responsible for budgeting the highway money. The state legislature maintains the ability to allocate both the money that is currently returned to local governments and the money spent on state programs in any way it chooses, just as it does now.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>What is the projected change in spending under Amendment 52?</B></I> Table 1 (please refer to the website of the Colorado General Assembly to view this table) shows the projected shift in spending from state programs to highway projects under Amendment 52. For example, in 2009, state programs receive $181 million under current law. Under Amendment 52, these programs receive $92 million, and $89 million is shifted to highway projects aimed at relieving congestion on I-70.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How are transportation projects currently funded?</B></I> Fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees, a portion of income and sales taxes, and federal highway money finance transportation projects in Colorado. The state received about $1.2 billion for transportation projects in budget year 2008, with fuel taxes and registration fees at $415 million, federal funds at $408 million, and income and sales taxes at $426 million.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How do Amendment 52 and Amendment 58 interact?</B></I> Both Amendment 52 and Amendment 58 change how the state spends severance tax revenue, but the two measures propose different uses for the money. Thus, some of the provisions of these measures appear to conflict with one another. Should both measures pass, the state will be required to implement these conflicting provisions, but if challenged the courts will have to decide how the measures take effect.

552,Colorado,2010,Application of the Term Person,"Amendment 62 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to apply the term ""person,"" as used in the sections of the Colorado bill of rights concerning inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law, to every human being from the beginning of the biological development of that human being.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Like the U.S. Constitution, the Colorado Constitution has a bill of rights. The Colorado bill of rights contains the rights of the people of Colorado and outlines the principles of state government. Amendment 62 addresses the application of the term ""person"" for sections 3, 6, and 25 of the Colorado bill of rights. These sections concern inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Inalienable rights.</B></I> Section 3 asserts that all persons have natural, essential, and inalienable rights to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire, possess, and protect property, and to seek and obtain safety and happiness. These rights include the right to survive, the right to defend against threats to safety, the freedom to make independent decisions, and the right to work and obtain economic goods. Inalienable rights are fundamental to all persons and are not created by laws and government. The constitution requires that the government protect these rights, although the government is permitted to limit the exercise of rights as necessary for the welfare and general security of the public.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional provision regarding inalienable rights has been applied by courts, for example, to guarantee the right of an individual to pursue a legitimate trade or business, to acquire property without fear of discrimination, and to travel freely around the state.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Equality of justice.</B></I> Section 6 requires the courts in Colorado to be open to all persons. If a person's legal rights are violated, this section guarantees that a judicial remedy is available.<BR>  <BR>  Courts have determined that this section applies to a variety of circumstances. For instance, individuals are denied equal access to justice if juries are chosen in a discriminatory manner. Additionally, all persons have the same right to use the courts regardless of their financial resources.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Due process of law.</B></I> Section 25 ensures that no person is deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Due process of law requires the government to follow consistent procedures before a person's fundamental rights are taken away.

553,Colorado,2010,Criteria for Release to Pretrial Services Programs,"Proposition 102 proposes amending the Colorado statutes to prohibit the release of a defendant on an unsecured bond to supervision by a pretrial services program unless that defendant is arrested for his or her first offense that is also a nonviolent misdemeanor.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  In the United States, an individual accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty. Most defendants have the right to be released on bail that is not excessive rather than remaining in jail pending the outcome of a trial. However, some serious crimes are not bailable offenses under Colorado law, including murder, kidnapping, and treason. In addition, persons arrested for a violent crime who have been previously convicted of a violent crime, or who are out on bail for a violent offense, are also not eligible for bail.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Definition of bail and bond.</B></I> After an individual is arrested, the court sets the amount of bail, the type of bond, and any other conditions of release. The primary purpose of bail is to ensure that the defendant appears for trial. A bond is an agreement between the defendant and the court under which the defendant agrees to comply with all of the conditions of release and to pay the bail amount if he or she does not appear in court.<BR>  <BR>  The court may order one of two types of bonds, unsecured or secured. With an unsecured bond, the defendant is released on his or her promise to appear, but is required to pay the bail amount if he or she does not appear in court. With a secured bond, the defendant either pays, or promises to pay through a commercial bail bondsman, an amount of money or interest in property before he or she may be released from jail pending trial. Although there are judicial district guidelines for setting bail, the court has the discretion to set the amount of bail and type of bond on a case-by-case basis after considering criteria set forth in law.<BR>  <BR>  If the defendant cannot afford to pay the bail amount, he or she can pay a fee to get a bond through a commercial bail bondsman, secure a bond using real estate, or remain in jail. In addition to financial conditions, the court may order any number of other conditions of release, which could include supervision by a pretrial services program.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Pretrial services programs.</B></I> Under current Colorado law, most defendants qualify for release to supervision by a pretrial services program on either a secured or unsecured bond. There are ten pretrial services programs that are publicly funded and serve over 70 percent of the state's population. The programs are located primarily along the Front Range, with the exceptions of Weld, Pueblo, and Mesa counties. Pretrial services programs provide two primary functions. First, they assess defendants and provide information and recommendations to the court regarding the defendant's risk to public safety and the likelihood that he or she will appear in court. The court uses this information in setting the defendant's amount of bail and type of bond.<BR>  <BR>  Second, pretrial services programs provide community-based supervision to monitor defendants prior to trial through various methods, such as periodic visits with the defendant, drug testing, and substance abuse treatment. Failure to comply with the pretrial services conditions may result in the defendant being returned to jail while awaiting trial.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Proposition 102.</B></I> Currently, the court may release the defendant to supervision by a pretrial services program on an unsecured or secured bond. Under Proposition 102, the defendant may only be released to a pretrial services program on an unsecured bond if the offense for which he or she has been charged is his or her first offense and is also a nonviolent misdemeanor. A misdemeanor is a crime, less serious than a felony, punishable by a fine and a term of imprisonment in a city or county jail as opposed to a state prison. In all other cases where the defendant receives pretrial services, the court must order a secured bond. This measure does not prohibit the court from releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond without pretrial services.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 102,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.38,Statutory,0
554,Colorado,2010,Exempt Possessory Interests in Real Property,"Amendment R proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to eliminate property taxes for individuals or businesses that use government-owned property for a private benefit worth $6,000 or less in market value.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <I><B>Property taxes and possessory interests.</I></B> Property taxes are based on the value of land, homes, buildings, and business equipment. Individuals and businesses pay property taxes to various local governments, such as cities, counties, school districts, and special districts. Property taxes pay for a variety of local government services, including public education, police and fire services, the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, parks and recreation facilities, hospitals, and libraries.<BR>  <BR>  When an individual or business uses government-owned land or equipment for private purposes, a possessory interest is created. Although government-owned property is exempt from taxes, the benefit that a business or individual obtains from using that land or equipment is not. For example, some ranchers lease land from the federal government for cattle grazing. Other businesses lease land to provide a recreational activity, such as skiing or river rafting. Under current law, the value of a private benefit is considered a possessory interest and is subject to property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  The market value of all possessory interests in Colorado is about $300 million, which is less than 0.1 percent of the total market value of all property in the state. At this value, total property tax payments for possessory interests are approximately $6 million annually. There are about 7,000 possessory interests in the state, which pay an average of $850 in property taxes annually.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment R change the taxation of possessory interests?</I></B>  Starting in 2012, Amendment R exempts a possessory interest from property taxation if the market value of the interest is $6,000 or less, which equates to a maximum tax payment of $120 annually, depending on local tax rates. For example, most cattle grazing leases with the federal government have a market value below $6,000, and therefore this private benefit would not be taxed. In contrast, the value of private benefits obtained by ski areas exceed the $6,000 threshold and will continue to be taxed at the full value. In budget year 2012-13, the measure is expected to reduce property taxes statewide by $160,000. Every two years, the $6,000 threshold is increased to account for inflation.",Amendment R,Legislative Referendum,Local Government,General,0.384,Amendment,0
555,Colorado,2010,Health Care Choice,"Amendment 63 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - add health care choice as a constitutional right;<BR>  - prohibit the state from requiring or enforcing any requirement that a person participate in a public or private health coverage plan; and<BR>  - restrict the state from limiting a person's ability to make or receive direct 6 payments for lawful health care services.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Amendment 63 adds health care choice as a right listed in the bill of rights in the Colorado Constitution. The measure specifies that the right to health care choice limits the ability of state government to either require health insurance or any other type of health care coverage, or to restrict direct payments for health care services.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Health care coverage requirements.</I> Colorado law does not require a person to have any type of health care coverage. A person may purchase coverage from a private insurer; participate in an employer-provided health plan; choose to enroll in a public program such as Medicaid and Medicare, if eligible; or have no coverage. If a person does not have health care coverage, or if his or her plan does not cover a specific service, services may be paid for out-of-pocket.<BR>  <BR>  In March 2010, a package of federal health care laws was adopted by the United States Congress and signed by the President. Beginning in 2014, most people are required to provide proof of acceptable health care coverage to the Internal Revenue Service. Persons without coverage are subject to a federal tax penalty.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Payments for health care services.</I> Currently, health care services can be paid for by health insurance companies, the government, patients, or some combination of these sources. When an individual has coverage, a third party, such as an insurance company or the government, negotiates with the provider to establish a price for health care services. Direct payments refer to when a person pays a provider directly, without seeking approval or reimbursement from a third party. No state or federal law prohibits a person from seeking services outside of a health care plan and paying a provider directly.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Effects of Amendment 63.</I> Amendment 63 does not change current health care coverage requirements, but it places restrictions on what the state may require in the future. For example, the state may offer new health coverage plans but, under Amendment 62, could not require a person to join a plan. The measure prohibits the state from: requiring a person to obtain health care coverage, regulating direct payments, or penalizing a person for either participating or not participating in any particular plan. The measure does not apply to workers' compensation insurance or mandatory emergency medical care.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 63 also prohibits the state from enforcing health care coverage requirements at the direction of the federal government. However, the measure does not impact the federal government's ability to enforce the coverage requirements created by federal health care laws. Coloradans are still required to have acceptable coverage under federal law beginning in 2014.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 63,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.469,Amendment,0
556,Colorado,2010,"Income, Motor Vehicle and Telecommunications Taxes and Fees","Proposition 101 proposes amending the Colorado statutes to:<BR>  - reduce the state income tax rate from 4.63 percent to 4.5 percent in 2011, and to 3.5 percent gradually over time;<BR>  - reduce or eliminate taxes and fees on vehicle purchases, registrations, leases, and rentals over the next four years;<BR>  - eliminate all state and local taxes and fees on telecommunication services, except 911 fees; and<BR>  - require voter approval to create or increase fees on vehicles and telecommunication services.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 reduces or eliminates various taxes and fees on income, vehicles, and telecommunication services. Some of the reductions in Proposition 101 are phased in over time. The impact will be smaller in the first year and will grow in size over the next 15 to 20 years. Estimates of the impact in the first year, as well as the impact once the reductions are fully implemented, are based on today's dollars. The fully implemented impacts provide the best estimates of the measure's final effects. Although the actual dollar amounts will differ in the future as inflation and growth increase the size of the economy, the comparable budget impacts on taxpayers and governments are expected to remain consistent over time.<BR>  <BR>  In the first year, the tax and fee reductions are expected to be $1.4 billion — $744 million in state reductions and $629 million in local government reductions. Once fully implemented, the impact is expected to be $2.9 billion in today's dollars — $1.9 billion in state reductions and $1.0 billion in local government reductions.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on households and businesses.</B></I> Households and businesses will be impacted differently depending on annual income, vehicles owned, vehicles purchased, and the amount paid for phone and cable service. Households and businesses will experience additional reductions during years in which vehicles are rented, leased, or purchased.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on government budgets.</B></I> As a result of the decrease in tax and fee collections, state and local governments will have to decrease spending and services, increase fees to pay for services, or some combination of both.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on local government budgets.</B></I> Local governments will collect less money from vehicle specific ownership taxes and sales taxes. Local governments affected by the measure include school districts, cities, counties, and special districts. Some examples of special districts include recreation, fire, water, sewer, and public transportation districts. The money collected in taxes and fees pays for different services depending on the local government. Most of the money is used for education, public safety, roads, trash service, and parks and recreation. State law requires that school districts be reimbursed by the state for most of their loss in tax collections.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on the state government operating budget.</B></I> The state government will collect less money from sales taxes, income taxes, and telecommunication fees. The state spends 96 percent of its general operating budget on: preschool through higher education; health care; prisons; the courts; and programs that help low-income, elderly, and disabled people. Proposition 101 will reduce the amount of money available to pay for the state's general operating budget by an estimated 6 percent in the first year and by an estimated 23 percent once fully implemented. Current law requires the state to reimburse school districts for most of their loss of vehicle specific ownership taxes. This obligation increases the total impact on the state general operating budget during the first year from $450 million to $497 million, and when fully implemented, from $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact on state and local government transportation budgets.</B></I> Proposition 101 reduces funding dedicated to transportation budgets. The state constitution requires that vehicle-related fees collected by the state be spent on road safety, construction, and maintenance. This money is shared between the state, cities, and counties. The state's transportation budget will decrease by an estimated 28 percent from these fee reductions. The impact on city and county government transportation budgets will vary by government. Because cuts affecting transportation budgets are immediate.<BR>  <BR>  <B>State Income Tax</B><BR>  <BR>  Households and businesses pay taxes on their income to both the state and federal governments. The state's income tax rate is a flat 4.63 percent and is the same for all income levels and for both households and businesses. The state income tax is the largest source of money the state receives to pay for its main programs.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 gradually lowers the state income tax rate from 4.63 percent to 3.5 percent over time. The rate is first lowered to 4.5 percent starting in 2011. This will reduce income tax collections to the state by an estimated $145 million, or 3 percent. The tax bill for a household with an annual income of $55,000 will be reduced by $40 in 2011. In the future, the rate is reduced by 0.1 percentage point each year in which state income tax collections grow by more than 6 percent. For example, if tax collections increase fast enough, the income tax rate will decrease from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent in 2012. This will occur until the income tax rate decreases to 3.5 percent.<BR>  <BR>  When the tax rate is fully reduced, income tax collections to the state will be an estimated 26 percent less, or $1.3 billion in today's dollars lower than what they would have been without Proposition 101. The tax bill for a household with an annual income of $55,000 will be reduced by $320 when the cut is fully phased in. Because income tax collections historically have not grown by more than 6 percent every year, it will likely take 15 to 20 years for the tax rate to decline to 3.5 percent.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Vehicle Fees and Taxes</B><BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 reduces several types of vehicle fees and taxes. Sales tax reductions on vehicle purchases and specific ownership tax reductions are phased in over a four-year period, while all other vehicle fee and tax changes occur in 2011. The total amount of the reduction in vehicle fees and taxes, when fully implemented, is estimated at $1.3 billion in today's dollars.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Vehicle owners.</B></I> Upon purchase, vehicle buyers are required to pay sales tax. In addition, each year vehicle owners must register their vehicle(s) with the state and pay registration fees and a specific ownership tax. Proposition 101 reduces all three taxes and fees.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I><U>Vehicle sales tax.</B></I></U> Sales taxes are paid on the purchase of a new or used vehicle. The tax is applied to the price of the vehicle, including any manufacturer's rebate. The total tax rate is a 2.9 percent state rate plus any applicable local government sales tax rates. Because different local governments have different tax rates, the sales tax a buyer pays differs depending on where the buyer lives. The average combined sales tax rate is close to 7 percent.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 reduces the sales taxes due on vehicle purchases by exempting the first $10,000 of the vehicle's price and any manufacturer's rebate from the sales tax. The $10,000 exemption is phased in over a four-year period beginning in 2011. When fully implemented, vehicles worth $10,000 or less will not have a sales tax bill. Vehicles with greater values will receive a $10,000 exemption. For example, a vehicle purchased for $18,000 will be taxed only on $8,000 of the value. This sales tax cut will reduce local government tax collections by an estimated $195 million, or 6 percent, and state government tax collections by an estimated $140 million, or 7 percent.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I><U>Vehicle registration and licensing fees.</B></I></U> Vehicle owners pay registration fees each year. Most fees vary according to vehicle weight, age, and value. While most of the money pays for roads and bridges, some pays for services like emergency medical services, vehicle emissions reduction programs, the Colorado State Patrol, and snow plowing.<BR>  <BR>  Beginning in 2011, Proposition 101 combines all registration, licensing, and titling fees into a single $10 annual fee, with the exception of vehicle inspection and new license plate fees. The average registration and licensing fee for vehicle owners would fall from $81 to $10 and the amount collected by state and local governments would decrease by about $300 million, or 88 percent.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I><U>Vehicle specific ownership tax.</B></I></U> Vehicle owners also pay a specific ownership tax each year when registering a vehicle. The specific ownership tax is a property tax on a vehicle. The tax ranges from 0.45 percent to 2.10 percent of the vehicle's taxable value, based on the vehicle's original recommended retail price. As a vehicle ages, the tax rate is reduced. The minimum specific ownership tax is either $3 or $5 per vehicle, depending on the type of vehicle. Counties collect specific ownership taxes and distribute them to schools, cities, counties, and special districts within their boundaries.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 phases in a cut to specific ownership taxes over four years, beginning in 2011. It also requires permission from voters to create or increase future registration and licensing fees. Table 3 shows the change in vehicle owners' bills and state and local government collections.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Vehicle lessees.</B></I> Like vehicle owners, persons who lease vehicles must pay sales taxes, registration fees, and specific ownership taxes each year. Proposition 101 reduces or ends all three taxes and fees for vehicle leases.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I><U>Vehicle sales tax and specific ownership tax.</B></I></U> Proposition 101 eliminates sales taxes and annual specific ownership taxes on leased vehicles beginning in 2011. This will reduce state and local sales tax collections by an estimated $65 million per year,or 1 percent. It will also eliminate all specific ownership taxes collected by local governments on leased vehicles.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I><U>Vehicle registration and licensing fees.</B></I></U> Leased vehicles are also required to be registered with the state and lessees must pay annual registration fees. Beginning in 2011, Proposition 101 eliminates all registration fees and imposes a single $10 fee per vehicle, resulting in a reduction of $71 for vehicle lessees. The measure reduces state and local collections by approximately $75 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Vehicle renters.</B><BR>  The state charges a fee of $2 per day for car rentals. The money is shared by the state, cities, and counties to build, repair, and maintain roads and bridges. Sales tax is also applied, with revenue going to the state and local governments. Proposition 101 eliminates the fee and all sales taxes beginning in 2011. As a result, state and local transportation budgets will have an estimated $19 million less per year in fee collections and $80 million less in sales tax collections.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Other vehicle fees.</B></I> The state also charges use and permitting fees for large and overweight vehicles that use Colorado roads. A passenger mile tax is also charged for passenger bus or shuttle businesses. Proposition 101 eliminates these fees beginning in 2011, resulting in $56 million less in state funds, reducing charges to trucking and carrier companies by a like amount.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Telecommunication Fees and Taxes</B><BR>  <BR>  21 Proposition 101 eliminates state and local sales tax and other fees on customer bills for any kind of telecommunications service, except for existing 911 fees. The measure lists the following as telecommunication services, even though some of them are not currently taxed: phone, pager, cable, television, radio, Internet, computer, and satellite services. Currently, the state and some local governments charge sales tax on a portion of the cost of phone and pager services, and some local governments charge sales tax on cable services. State fees that are eliminated include fees that help telephone companies provide access to phone service in rural areas of the state, to the blind, deaf, or speech impaired, and to low-income people. How the elimination of these telephone fees will affect these services is unclear and would likely be determined by the state legislature. However, telephone services for the deaf or speech impaired are required by federal law. Thus, its likely that another funding source will have to be found to continue to provide these services. Local governments may have other fees, such as television franchise fees, that may be eliminated.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 freezes 911 fees at their 2009 level. These fees differ from county to county and ranged from 43 cents to $1.25 per month in 2009. The 911 fees are charged by local governments to help pay for 911 emergency services.<BR>  <BR>  The reduction in a household or business's telecommunications bill depends on how much it spends on taxable phone and cable. Tax and fee collections by local governments would be reduced by at least $194 million each year. Tax and fee collections to the state government would be reduced by an estimated $183 million each year.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>New voter approval requirements.</B></I> Proposition 101 redefines all telecommunication fees and most vehicle fees as taxes. Because the state constitution requires a vote to increase taxes but not to increase fees, governments will need to ask voters for permission to create new or increase existing vehicle or telecommunication charges in the future. Proposition 101 excludes vehicle-related fines, parking fees, tolls, vehicle impound fees, vehicle identification and emission inspection fees, and new license plate fees from this requirement.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How does Proposition 101 interact with two other measures on the ballot?</B></I>  Proposition 101 along with Amendment 60 and Amendment 61  contain provisions that affect state and local government finances by decreasing taxes paid by households and businesses and restricting government borrowing. How these measures work together may require clarification from the state legislature or the courts.<BR>  <BR>  Proposition 101 reduces state and local government taxes and fees. Amendment 60 reduces local property taxes, while requiring state expenditures for K-12 education to increase by an amount that offsets the property tax loss for school districts. Amendment 61 requires state and local governments to decrease tax rates when debt is repaid, which is assumed in this analysis to apply to the existing debt of state and local governments, and it prohibits any borrowing by state government.<BR>  <BR>  Since portions of these measures are phased in over time, the actual impacts to taxpayers and governments will be less in the initial years of implementation and grow over time. Assuming that all three measures are approved by voters, the first-year impact will be to reduce state taxes and fees by $744 million and increase state spending for K-12 education by $385 million. Once fully implemented, the measures are estimated to reduce state taxes and fees by $2.1 billion and increase state spending for K-12 education by $1.6 billion in today's dollars. This would commit almost all of the state's general operating budget to paying for the constitutional and statutory requirements of K-12 education, leaving little for other government services. In addition, the prohibition on borrowing will increase budget pressures for the state if it chooses to pay for capital projects from its general operating budget. This would further reduce the amount of money available for other government services.<BR>  <BR>  Tax and fee collections for local governments are expected to fall by at least $966 million in the first year of implementation and by $4.7 billion when the measures are fully implemented. However, the net impact on local government budgets would be at least $581 million in the first year and $3.1 billion when fully implemented after the state reimburses school districts.<BR>  <BR>  Total taxes and fees paid by households and businesses are estimated to decrease by $1.7 billion in the first year and $6.8 billion per year in today's dollars when the measures are fully implemented. The measures reduce the taxes and fees owed by an average household making $55,000 per year that owns a $295,000 house by an estimated $400 in the first year and $1,660 per year when fully implemented.<BR>  [S]",Proposition 101,Initiative,Tax & Revenue,General,0.32299999999999995,Statutory,0
557,Colorado,2010,Limits on State and Local Government Borrowing,"Amendment 61 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - prohibit all new state government borrowing after 2010;<BR>  - prohibit new local government borrowing after 2010, unless approved by voters;<BR>  - limit the amount and length of time of local government borrowing; and<BR>  - require that tax rates be reduced after borrowing is fully repaid.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Amendment 61 places new restrictions on government borrowing. Currently, the state and local governments borrow money to build or improve public facilities like roads, buildings, and airports and repay the money over multiple years. Borrowing is also used for other purposes, such as financing loans for small businesses.<BR>  <BR>  Beginning in 2011, Amendment 61 prohibits all future borrowing by state government and limits future borrowing by local governments, including cities, counties, school districts, special districts, and enterprises. The measure also requires that governments lower tax rates after borrowed money is fully repaid, even if the borrowing was repaid from a source other than taxes. In certain cases, governments borrow money on behalf of private entities. Because the private entities are solely responsible for repayment, it is unclear if this borrowing is covered by the provisions of Amendment 61.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>Impact of Amendment 61 on state government.</I></B> Amendment 61 affects Colorado's state government by prohibiting any future borrowing and requiring a tax cut when certain borrowing is fully repaid. Current borrowing will be unaffected, but future projects, programs, and services that would have otherwise been financed through borrowing will have to be eliminated or paid for by increasing fees or using money currently budgeted for other purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The state and all of its enterprises issue an average of $2.9 billion in new borrowing annually and spend about $2 billion annually to repay borrowing. State agencies, excluding enterprises, make annual payments of about $200 million on borrowing. At the end of 2010, the state and all of its enterprises will owe about $17 billion for assets financed through borrowing.<BR>  <BR>  Under current law, the state borrows money in the following ways, which will no longer be permitted by Amendment 61:<BR>  • <I>Long-term borrowing</I> — Long-term borrowing is money borrowed for a period of more than one year that is repaid from a specific source of money like dedicated taxes or fees over a fixed period of time. Voters must approve non-enterprise borrowing. For example, in 1999 voters approved borrowing for state highway projects. The money that was borrowed for the projects is repaid with state and federal highway funds.<BR>  • <I>Short-term borrowing</I> — In Colorado, the state sometimes borrows money early in the year to cover costs for its day-to-day operations and repays the money later in the year, as revenues are collected.<BR>  • <I>Lease-to-own agreements</I> — Lease-to-own agreements allow the state to make annual payments for new buildings or equipment over a number of years until the cost is repaid. The state legislature authorizes lease-to-own agreements and approves payments every year during its annual budget process. Once the cost is paid, ownership is typically transferred to the state. The state is currently using lease-to-own agreements to build a prison, a museum, a court building, and several academic buildings at state colleges and universities. The state is also using these types of agreements for K-12 school construction and renovation.<BR>  • <I>Enterprise borrowing</I> — Publicly owned enterprises are currently permitted to borrow for projects and programs without voter approval. Generally, enterprises generate their own revenue through fees charged for the services they offer. Enterprises usually borrow with long-term borrowing repaid from grants or fees for services. Enterprises do not have a defined voter base, and do not hold public elections.<BR>  <BR>  Most public colleges and universities are enterprises and have recently borrowed money to build classroom buildings and other facilities. This borrowing is repaid from sources such as tuition money, student fees, donations, and federal grants. Other state-level enterprises, such as the Colorado Housing and Finance authority, act as financing authorities to borrow money that is lent to local governments, private businesses, and individuals.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact of Amendment 61 on local governments.</B></I> Amendment 61 applies new borrowing limits to all local governments and requires that all future borrowing be submitted for voter approval. Similar to the impact on state government, Amendment 61 will require local governments to either increase fees, reduce construction, or reduce programs or services.<BR>  <BR>  Local governments and their enterprises issue an average of $4.9 billion in new borrowing annually, and spend about $4.3 billion annually to repay borrowing. Local governments, excluding enterprises, make annual payments of about $2.2 billion on borrowing. Currently, local governments and their enterprises owe about $36 billion for assets financed through borrowing. Some local government borrowing is repaid from voter approved tax increases. After this borrowing is fully repaid, tax rates will be reduced, regardless of the outcome of Amendment 61.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 61 limits allowable local government borrowing in the following ways:<BR>  • <I>Borrowing is limited to bonded debt.</I> Bonded debt is money that is borrowed through the sale of government bonds for a period of more than one year. Under current law, local governments may borrow money through bonded debt as well as other forms of borrowing, such as short-term borrowing or lease-to-own agreements. Amendment 61 prohibits all forms of local government borrowing except bonded debt.<BR>  • <I>Voter approval is required for all borrowing.</I> Under current law, not all borrowing requires voter approval, and elections for bonded debt occur at various times throughout the year depending on the type of local government. Amendment 61 requires that all future borrowing first be submitted for approval by voters at a November election. In addition, enterprises, which were not previously required to seek voter approval for borrowing, will be required to hold elections.<BR>  • <I>For all local governments, except enterprises, borrowing is limited to 10 percent of the assessed real property value within its borders.</I> Generally speaking, this cap is less than what is allowed under current law. A local government that has already borrowed an amount more than the 10 percent cap would be prohibited from additional borrowing until it repays enough of its borrowing or real property values increase enough to drop its total borrowing below the 10 percent cap.<BR>  • <I>Borrowing must be repaid within 10 years and may be repaid early without penalty.</I> The typical term of current borrowing is 20 to 30 years. Borrowing for a shorter length of time requires higher annual payments because the loan is spread over fewer years; however, total interest costs over the term of the loan are lower.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Impact of Amendment 61 on taxpayers.</B></I> Amendment 61 requires that after borrowed money is fully repaid by a government, taxes must be reduced in the amount of the average annual payment. Assuming this requirement applies to current borrowing, and once the measure is fully implemented, state taxes will be reduced by about $200 million. Local government taxes are estimated to be reduced by $2.2 billion. This amount includes some bonded debt for which the tax rate will decline regardless of the outcome of Amendment 61. Some tax reductions will occur in the first few years after the measure takes effect, but the full reduction will not occur until all borrowed money is repaid, which could take up to 40 years.<BR>  <BR>  If the entire state tax reduction is applied to the state income tax, an average household earning $55,000 annually will pay about $49 less per year in today's dollars once the measure is fully implemented. If the entire local tax reduction is applied to property taxes, the owners of a home valued at $295,000 will pay about $529 less per year in today's dollars. The impact of the local tax reduction will vary based on the location of a taxpayer's residence.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>How does Amendment 61 interact with two other measures on the ballot?</B></I> Amendment 61 along with Amendment 60 and Proposition 101 contain provisions that affect state and local government finances by decreasing taxes paid by households and businesses and restricting government borrowing.

558,Colorado,2010,Property Taxes,"Amendment 60 proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - repeal the current voter-approved authority of local governments to keep property taxes above their constitutional limits;<BR>  - establish expiration dates for future voter-approved property tax increases;<BR>  - cut local property tax rates for public schools' operating expenses in half over ten years and replace this money with state funding each year;<BR>  - require publicly owned enterprises to pay property taxes and reduce local property tax rates to offset the new revenue; and<BR>  - provide new voting rights to certain property owners in Colorado and permit citizens to petition all local governments to reduce property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Amendment 60 changes several aspects of Colorado's property tax system to reduce the amount of property taxes paid by individuals and businesses to school districts, counties, special districts, cities, and towns. The measure phases in a reduction in school district property taxes over ten years and requires that the reduced property taxes be replaced with state funding.<BR>  <BR>  In the first year, property taxes for school districts are expected to fall by $337 million, which the measure requires the state to replace. This represents a property tax reduction of the same amount for individuals and businesses. An average homeowner's property tax bill is projected to fall by $87 and the property taxes for an average commercial business are estimated to fall by $1,181.<BR>  <BR>  When the measure is fully implemented, the property tax reduction for school districts is estimated to increase the state's obligation for kindergarten through twelfth grade education (K-12) by $1.5 billion, which represents a property tax decrease of the same amount for individuals and businesses. An average homeowner will pay $376 less and an average commercial business will pay $5,106 less in property taxes annually. In future years, the actual amounts will differ as inflation and growth increase the size of the economy, but the comparable budget impacts on taxpayers and governments are expected to remain consistent over time.  Cities, towns, counties, and special districts will also lose property taxes, but the amount will vary by locality.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>Background and current law.</I></B> Property taxes are based primarily on the value of land, houses, other buildings, and business equipment. Individuals and businesses pay property taxes to various local governments, such as cities, counties, school districts, and special districts, each of which imposes its own tax rate on property. School districts and counties receive approximately 77 percent of all property taxes collected. Publicly owned enterprises, such as city water and sewer systems, municipal airports, and most state universities, are exempt from paying property tax.<BR>  <BR>  Property taxes are spent on a variety of local government services, including public education, police and fire services, roads and bridges, public water and sewer systems, parks and recreation facilities, hospitals, and libraries. The degree to which local governments rely on property taxes to pay for services varies. Some special districts, such as fire protection districts, get almost all of their revenue from property taxes, while many city governments get less than percent of their funding from property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>Constitutional limits on property taxes.</I></B> The state constitution currently restricts both the amount of total revenue and property tax revenue that a local government can collect each year. Annual increases for each are capped at the rate of inflation plus a measure of local growth, such as student enrollment in the case of a school district. The constitution also requires voter approval for a local government to increase property tax rates or to keep and spend total revenue or property tax revenue above the government's constitutional limit.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 change how public schools are funded?</I></B> Public schools in Colorado are funded from a combination of federal, state, and local sources. Voters in some school districts have approved additional property taxes to repay loans used to build schools or other buildings. In these districts, there is a property tax for operating schools and a separate property tax to repay loans. Amendment 60 requires all districts to cut their 2011 property tax rates for operating schools in half by 2020. Property tax rates for repaying loans are unchanged. The required reduction in tax rates must be done in equal yearly amounts over ten years. Amendment 60 requires the local school district funding eliminated by this rate reduction to be replaced each year with state funding.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 affect the state budget?</I></B> Currently, the state spends most of its general operating budget on:  preschool through higher education; health care; prisons; the courts; and programs that help low-income, elderly, and disabled people. K-12 education funding accounts for 46 percent of this budget, which is primarily funded by sales and income taxes. Because Amendment 60 requires that the reduction in local property tax revenue be replaced with state funding, the obligation for public schools will increase to an estimated 67 percent of the state's general operating budget, once the measure is fully implemented. To meet this increased obligation to schools, the state will have to decrease spending and services in other areas, increase fees for services, or some combination of both.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 affect property taxes for all local governments?</I></B>  Like school districts, cities, counties, and special districts are also funded from a combination of federal, state, and local sources. Under current law, taxpayers in many communities have voted to broadly exempt their local governments from the constitutional limit related to total revenue and spending. Currently, voters in 76 percent of municipalities, 81 percent of counties, and 98 percent of school districts have voted to allow government to keep and spend revenue above the constitutional limit, either temporarily or permanently. This measure would reimpose a property tax limit for those governments, leaving the broader revenue exemption unchanged.<BR>  <BR>  Beginning in 2011, Amendment 60 repeals the current voter-approved authority of local governments to permanently keep property taxes above their constitutional limits. Local governments are not required to refund the property taxes that were retained in the past. However, local governments that collect property taxes above their property tax limit in the future will have to refund money. A new election must be held to allow a local government to keep future property taxes above its constitutional limit for up to four years at a time. The measure will also reduce the property tax collections of most local governments by reducing property tax rates, and limiting the duration of future property tax increases.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 affect publicly owned enterprises?</I></B> Amendment 60 requires publicly owned enterprises to pay property taxes. Under current law, state enterprises, such as most public universities, do not pay property taxes on campus buildings or equipment. Similarly, local enterprises, such as Denver International Airport, pay no property taxes. The new property taxes collected from these publicly owned enterprises must be offset by lower property tax rates for homeowners, businesses, and other property taxpayers. For example, if the University of Colorado had to pay property taxes in Boulder County, its property tax bill is estimated to range from $11 million to $20 million per year, depending on how the property is valued. This new revenue would be offset by lower tax rates in Boulder County, providing property owners in the county with tax reductions in the same amount. The amendment prohibits publicly owned enterprises from charging either a mandatory fee or a tax on property.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 change property tax elections?</I></B> Amendment 60 proposes changing several aspects of the way property tax issues are addressed in local elections. Under current law, a property owner who is a registered Colorado voter may vote on ballot questions in his or her primary place of residence and in special district elections wherever he or she owns property in Colorado. Amendment 60 allows Colorado property owners to vote on city, county, and school district property tax issues in any Colorado location where they own property, regardless of their primary place of residence in the state.<BR>  <BR>  Under current law, citizens may petition cities to increase or decrease property taxes, but may not petition counties, schools, or special districts. Under this measure, all local governments must permit petitions to lower property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Typically, when a local community has voted to permanently exempt its local government from the constitutional limit on property tax collections, that voter-approved decision is not automatically repealed at a future date. Under Amendment 60, any future vote to allow a local government to retain revenue above its constitutional limit is repealed within four years after passage. Any future vote to increase property tax rates is repealed within ten years. Any extension of an expiring property tax is considered to be a tax increase under the measure, and as such, must be presented as a tax increase on the ballot.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, a single ballot question may ask voters if a local government may borrow money, and if property tax rates may be increased to repay that loan. Under this measure, ballot questions that allow a government to borrow money must be separate from ballot questions that raise property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How is Amendment 60 enforced?</I></B> The amendment requires the state to annually audit all cities, counties, school districts, and other types of local governments to ensure compliance with all requirements of the amendment. Citizens are also allowed to file lawsuits to enforce compliance.<BR>  <BR>  <I><B>How does Amendment 60 interact with two other measures on the ballot?</I></B>  Amendment 60 along with Amendment 61 and Proposition 101 contain provisions that affect state and local government finances by decreasing taxes paid by households and businesses and restricting government borrowing. How these measures work together may require clarification from the state legislature or the courts.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 60 reduces local property taxes, while requiring state expenditures for K-12 education to increase by an amount that offsets the property tax loss for school districts. Amendment 61 requires state and local governments to decrease tax rates when debt is repaid, which is assumed in this analysis to apply to the existing debt of state and local governments, and it prohibits any borrowing by state government.  Proposition 101 reduces state and local government taxes and fees.<BR>  <BR>  Since portions of these measures are phased in over time, the actual impacts to taxpayers and governments will be less in the initial years of implementation and grow over time. Assuming that all three measures are approved by voters, the first-year impact will be to reduce state taxes and fees by $744 million and increase state spending for K-12 education by $385 million. Once fully implemented, the measures are estimated to reduce state taxes and fees by $2.1 billion and increase state spending for K-12 education by $1.6 billion in today's dollars. This would commit almost all of the state's general operating budget to paying for the constitutional and statutory requirements of K-12 education, leaving little for other government services. In addition, the prohibition on borrowing will increase budget pressures for the state if it chooses to pay for capital projects from its general operating budget. This would further reduce the amount of money available for other government services.<BR>  <BR>  Tax and fee collections for local governments are expected to fall by at least $966 million in the first year of implementation and by $4.7 billion when the measures are fully implemented. However, the net impact on local government budgets would be at least $581 million in the first year and $3.1 billion when fully implemented after the state reimburses school districts.<BR>  <BR>  Total taxes and fees paid by households and businesses are estimated to decrease by $1.7 billion in the first year and $6.8 billion per year in today's dollars when the measures are fully implemented. The measures reduce the taxes and fees owed by an average household making $55,000 per year that owns a $295,000 house by an estimated $400 in the first year and $1,660 per year when fully implemented.<BR>  [CA]",Amendment 60,Initiative,Education: PreK-12,General,0.245,Amendment,0
559,Colorado,2010,Regulation of Games of Chance,"Amendment P proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - transfer the licensing of games of chance, such as bingo and raffles, from the Department of State to the Department of Revenue; and<BR>  - allow the state legislature to change the department of oversight and the requirement that an organization exist for five years with a dues-paying membership.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Colorado law allows certain nonprofit organizations to use bingo and raffles to raise money for charity. Bingo and raffles are games in which prizes are won based on randomly picked numbers. Since 1958, the Department of State has regulated these games by issuing licenses, collecting fees, conducting inspections, addressing complaints, and imposing penalties. Currently, organizations must have been in existence for five years with a dues-paying membership to qualify for a license.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment P allows the state legislature to choose a state agency to regulate bingo and raffles. The legislature may also change the licensing requirement that an organization must have operated for five years. During the 2010 session, the state legislature passed a bill selecting the Department of Revenue to regulate bingo and raffles if Amendment P is adopted.<BR>  <BR>  The Department of Revenue currently regulates casino gambling, licenses casinos and casino employees, conducts compliance audits, and approves casino gambling devices. The department also operates the Colorado Lottery.",Amendment P,Legislative Referendum,Gambling & Lotteries,General,0.377,Amendment,0
560,Colorado,2010,Temporary Location for the State Seat of Government,"Amendment Q proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to establish a process for moving the state seat of government to a temporary location during a declared disaster emergency.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Since statehood, the Colorado Constitution has designated Denver as the state seat of government. The legislature is prohibited from moving the seat of government out of Denver unless it refers the question to the voters at a general election.  The question must be approved by at least a two-thirds vote.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment Q creates a process for temporarily moving the seat of government when a disaster emergency affects the ability of state government to operate in Denver. It defines a disaster emergency as the occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury, illness, or loss of life or property resulting from an epidemic or a natural, man-made, or technological event. For the purpose of addressing such emergencies, it also defines the seat of government as the location of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the state of Colorado.<BR>  <BR>  After declaring a disaster emergency, and after consulting with the Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Governor may designate a temporary meeting location for the state legislature. The legislature must meet at that location and decide whether to enact a bill designating a temporary location for the seat of government outside of Denver. Such legislation must include a date when the temporary location of the seat of government expires. Amendment Q does not change the process for permanently moving the state seat of government. Currently, 36 other states have created a legal process to temporarily move the seat of state government in an emergency.",Amendment Q,Legislative Referendum,State Government,General,0.575,Amendment,1
561,Colorado,2011,Temporary Tax Increase for Public Education,"NOTE: Colorado's general election will be held on November 1, 2011.<BR>  Proposition 103 proposes amending the Colorado  statutes to:<BR>  - increase the state income tax rate from 4.63 to 5.0 percent for five years, starting January 1, 2012;<BR>  - increase the state sales and use tax rate from 2.9 to  3.0 percent for five years, starting January 1, 2012; and<BR>  - require the state legislature to spend the money on public education by increasing funding above the amount in budget year 2011-12.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Proposition 103 temporarily increases the state income and sales and use tax rates and requires the state to spend the money on public education. Public education includes public preschools, kindergarten through 12th grade schools, and colleges and universities.<BR>  <BR>  <I>What is the state income tax?</I> Households and businesses pay taxes on their income to both the state and federal governments. State income taxes are calculated by applying a fixed rate to a taxpayer's Colorado taxable income. The state income tax is the largest source of revenue the state collects to pay for its main programs. The state's current income tax rate is 4.63 percent for both households and businesses, regardless of income level. In 1987, the state moved from a graduated income tax rate to a single tax rate, which was initially set at 5.0 percent. This rate was reduced to 4.75 percent in 1999, and reduced again to 4.63 percent in 2000. The measure returns the rate to 5.0 percent for five years, after which it will be restored to 4.63 percent.<BR>  <BR>  <I>What is the state sales and use tax?</I> The state sales tax is paid on the purchase price of most items. Some items are exempt, such as food bought at grocery stores, prescription drugs, and household electricity and heat. The tax applies to some services, most notably local telephone service, cell phone service, food and drink service at restaurants and bars, and lodging. The state use tax is paid on taxable items for which the sales tax was not collected, such as items bought from sellers outside the state. In addition to the state sales and use tax, local governments also have sales and use taxes, although local rates may be different and may apply to different items than the state tax. In 2000, the state legislature reduced the sales and use tax rate from 3.0 to 2.9 percent. Proposition 103 returns the rate to 3.0 percent for five years, after which it will be restored to 2.9 percent. The measure does not affect local tax rates.<BR>  <BR>  <I>How much money will the state collect under Proposition 103?</I> Over the five-year period of the tax rate increase, the state will collect about $2.9 billion in new tax revenue for public education.<BR>  <BR>  <I>How much will state income taxes increase under  Proposition 103?</I> Currently, Colorado taxpayers pay $46.30 in state income taxes for each $1,000 of taxable income. Under Proposition 103, taxpayers will pay $50.00 in state income taxes for each $1,000 of taxable income, or about 8 percent more than under current law. Taxpayers will pay the higher rate for five years, beginning with the tax payment due in April 2013 for the 2012 tax year. An individual's taxable income is equal to the person's gross income minus deductions, exemptions, or other adjustments. It varies based on marital status, the number of dependents, business exemptions, and other factors such as deductions for mortgage interest, charitable contributions, or interest paid on student loans.<BR>  <BR>  <I>What does the state spend on public education?</I> For budget year 2011-12, the state’s portion of public school funding is currently set at $3.7 billion for preschool through high school education and $624 million for higher education. This amount may change, for example, when mid-year adjustments are made to balance the budget. Combined, spending on public education represents about 50 percent of the General Fund, which pays for the state's general operating expenses. Direct state funding for public education has declined in the past few years, although some of these reductions have been offset with other sources of money. Local communities contribute taxes and fees, and universities and colleges charge tuition and fees and seek private donations. In addition, the federal government provides funding for a variety of education programs. The combination of these funds pays for programs and services such as classroom instruction, preschool programs, administrative services provided by the state, and financial aid to students attending public universities and colleges.<BR>  <BR>  <I>How does Proposition 103 impact state spending on  education?</I> The measure sets budget year 2011-12 state funding for public education — currently about $4.3 billion — as a minimum funding level for five years. It requires that the money raised through the tax increase be allocated in addition to, not as a substitute for, this amount. Although Proposition 103 requires that the money raised be spent on public education, it does not specify how the money is to be split between the various preschool through high school and higher education programs.",Proposition 103,Initiative,Education: Higher Ed,General,0.368,Statutory,0
562,Colorado,2012,Colorado Congressional Delegation to Support Campaign Finance Limits,"Proposes amending the Colorado Constitution and Colorado statutes to:<BR>  - instruct the Colorado congressional delegation to propose and support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that allows Congress and the states to limit campaign contributions and spending; and<BR>  -  instruct the state legislature to ratify any such amendment passed by Congress.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Colorado and federal law currently limit the amount of money that individuals, political action committees, and other organizations may give directly to candidates, campaigns, political parties, and other political groups. Colorado has also established voluntary spending limits that political candidates and campaigns may choose to follow. However, there are no mandatory limits in state or federal law on how much money campaigns may spend overall.<BR>  <BR>  In the past, courts have ruled that limiting contributions to candidates and campaigns is a permissible restriction on money in politics so as to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption. However, the courts have also ruled that spending money is a form of protected political speech. Therefore, overall spending limits on campaigns are not allowed, and spending by persons and organizations who are independent of political campaigns cannot be restricted.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Changes under Amendment 65.</B></I> The measure does not directly affect current state or federal campaign finance laws, or create campaign spending limits. Instead, it amends state law to encourage Congress and the state legislature to take steps to amend the U.S. Constitution to allow greater limits on the role of money in state and federal elections. The measure also expresses the intent of voters that state law should establish mandatory campaign spending limits, rather than encourage voluntary spending limits.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Amending the U.S. Constitution.</B></I> An amendment to the U.S. Constitution may be proposed with a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress.

563,Colorado,2012,State Personnel System,"Amendment S proposes amending the Colorado Constitution to:<BR>  - increase the number and types of state employees who may be exempt from the state civil service system, also known as the state personnel system;<BR>  - change testing and hiring procedures for filling vacancies in the state personnel system;<BR>  - expand hiring preferences for veterans; and<BR>  - adjust the terms of service and duties for members of the State Personnel Board, and the standard to remove certain members.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  <BR>  The State of Colorado employs about 74,150 individuals in full- and part-time positions within the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. These positions are generally categorized as classified (about 33,000 current employees) or nonclassified (about 41,150 current employees). All employees are covered under applicable state and federal employment laws, such as those protecting against discrimination. The measure applies only to classified employees in the state personnel system.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State personnel system.</B></I> In 1918, Colorado voters amended the state constitution to create the state personnel system. It currently requires that:<BR>  • employees be hired and promoted according to merit and fitness;<BR>  • job candidates be scored and ranked using a competitive exam;<BR>  • hiring decisions be made from among job candidates with the three highest scores on competitive exams;<BR>  • eligible veterans be able to receive a hiring preference for only one position;<BR>  • positions be filled by Colorado residents unless certain conditions are met; and<BR>  • employees provide 12 months of satisfactory service before becoming certified as classified.<BR>  <BR>  Other portions of the system are governed by state law or rule, including processes to evaluate candidates and job performance, respond to grievances, and terminate employment. The system is administered by the state personnel director (head of the Department of Personnel and Administration), with oversight from the independent State Personnel Board.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Exemption from the state personnel system.</B></I> Exempted positions are specifically listed in the state constitution and include most employees of the state courts, the legislature, and the state's institutions of higher education, as well as department heads and members of certain boards and commissions. Political  appointees serving the administration of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor are also exempt. Similar to the private sector, exempted employees and their state agency employers may each end the employment relationship at any time. In these positions, there are no universal standards for evaluating candidates, assessing job performance, or responding to grievances.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment S allows the state personnel director to exempt certain additional management and support positions, up to 1 percent of the total number of employees in the state personnel system. Based on the current figure of about 33,000 classified employees, the measure allows an estimated 330 new positions to be exempted. Currently, most departments have only one exempt position, the department head. If voters approve Amendment S, additional exemptions may include deputy department heads, chief financial officers, public information officers, legislative liaisons, human resource directors, executive assistants to department heads, and members of the senior executive service (SES). The SES is a performance pay plan authorized by state statute to compensate up to 125 positions with a high level of management responsibility. SES positions are currently allocated according to department size, and new exemptions may be similarly distributed.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Evaluating and hiring job candidates.</B></I> Currently, candidates must be ranked based on the results of a competitive exam using criteria set by each department and following rules issued by the State Personnel Board. In practice, each candidate is awarded up to 100 points based on the results of his or her exam, with additional points awarded if he or she qualifies for a veterans' preference. The measure allows for the use of other objective methods to evaluate, compare, and rank job candidates. These other methods may include written exams, oral boards, search committees, or the use of non-numerical criteria, as long as they meet professionally accepted standards.<BR>  <BR>  Current law requires hiring managers to choose among the three candidates with the highest scores. Amendment S allows the top six candidates to be considered, regardless of the evaluation and ranking method used. Under the measure, the state personnel director, rather than the State Personnel Board, will be required to issue rules for the evaluation and ranking of candidates through the public rule-making process.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Hiring preferences for veterans.</B></I> Under the current evaluation process, an eligible veteran or his or her surviving spouse receives five additional points on his or her competitive exam score. A disabled veteran receives ten additional points. Once an individual has been hired by the state using a veterans' preference, he or she may not apply the preference again to another position. Amendment S allows a veteran to continue to use preference points when applying for most other positions in the system.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Hiring temporary employees.</B></I> Colorado's constitution allows for temporary employment of persons for up to 6 months to address a short-term or urgent hiring need. State rules clarify that a temporary appointment may not exceed 6 months within a 12-month period. The measure extends the time limit for temporary employment to 9 months, and state rules may be adjusted accordingly.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Residency.</B></I> Colorado's constitution requires that positions within the personnel system be filled by residents of Colorado unless the State Personnel Board finds the position requires special education or special qualifications and the position cannot be readily filled by a Colorado resident. Amendment S gives the state personnel director the authority to waive residency requirements as well. It also eliminates the residency requirement for positions located within 30 miles of the state border.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>State personnel system oversight.</B></I> The five-member State Personnel Board, which includes three members appointed by the Governor and two members elected by classified employees, sets policy for the system. None of the members may be a state employee. Currently, board members may serve an unlimited number of five-year terms and may only be removed for cause. The board is responsible for setting rules for conducting competitive exams used to evaluate candidates for positions in the system, approving exemptions from residency requirements, and hearing appeals to certain decisions made by the state personnel director.<BR>  <BR>  If approved, Amendment S:<BR>  • reduces board terms from five years to three years for members appointed or elected after January 1, 2013;<BR>  • limits board members from serving more than two terms;<BR>  • allows two appointees to serve or be removed at the Governor's pleasure;<BR>  • removes the authority of the board to set rules for the process and criteria used to evaluate and hire candidates for positions in the system; and<BR>  • allows the state personnel director to set the rules for evaluating and hiring candidates and to approve residency exemptions.",Amendment S,Legislative Referendum,Labor & Employment,General,0.561,Amendment,1
564,Colorado,2012,Use and Regulation of Marijuana,"Amendment 64 proposes amending the Colorado  Constitution to:<BR>  <BR>  - regulate the growth, manufacture, and sale of marijuana in a system of licensed establishments overseen by state and local governments;<BR>  - allow individuals who are 21 years old or older to possess, use, display, purchase, transport, and transfer—to individuals who are 21 years old or older—one ounce or less of marijuana;<BR>  - allow individuals who are 21 years old or older to possess, grow, process, and transport up to six marijuana plants, with certain restrictions;<BR>  - require the state legislature to enact an excise tax on marijuana sales, of which the first $40 million in revenue raised annually must be credited to a state fund used for constructing public schools. The excise tax must be approved by a separate statewide vote; and<BR>  - require the state legislature to enact legislation concerning the growth, processing, and sale of industrial hemp.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary and Analysis</B><BR>  Marijuana is a plant that contains the psychoactive component delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Marijuana can be used in various ways, including smoking it, inhaling it as vapor, and consuming it in food. Currently, individuals who grow, transfer, manufacture, possess, or sell marijuana violate federal, state, and, in some cases, local laws. However, state penalties for marijuana offenses are not as severe as penalties for many other drug-related offenses. Although the use of marijuana for medical purposes is not authorized under federal law, Colorado and several other states have enacted legislation allowing the use of medical marijuana. To date, state regulation of medical marijuana establishments has generally been allowed to occur, although the federal government has ordered some businesses to close.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Current federal and state penalties for marijuana offenses.</B></I><BR>  Sentences for drug offenses are discretionary, and depend on the law violated and the severity and circumstances of the crime. Under federal law, penalties for marijuana offenses range from up to one year in prison and a fine of $1,000 for a first offense of possession, to up to life in prison and a fine of $4 million for the sale of 1,000 kilograms (about 2,200 pounds) or more of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  Under current state law, marijuana offenses range from a class 2 petty offense to a class 3 felony. For example, individuals accused of possession of two ounces of marijuana or less may be required to appear in court and, if convicted, can be fined up to a maximum of $100. Other penalties range from no jail time or fine for sharing small amounts of marijuana without payment, to up to 12 years in prison, a fine of $750,000, or both for transferring any amount of marijuana to a person under 15 years old, provided that the offender is at least 18 years old, or for knowingly distributing more than 100 pounds of marijuana. Individuals convicted of marijuana offenses are also required to pay a drug offender surcharge, which may range from $200 to $3,000, depending on the severity of the crime. It is not clear how the state's current criminal laws would be changed in response to Amendment 64.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Personal use of marijuana.</B></I><BR> Under the measure, individuals who are 21 years old or older (adults) may possess, use, display, purchase, and transport up to one ounce of marijuana. Adults may share up to one ounce of marijuana with other individuals who are at least 21 years old, but are not allowed to sell marijuana. The use of marijuana in public or in a manner that endangers others is prohibited. The measure allows adults to grow their own marijuana or to purchase marijuana from a licensed retail marijuana store with proof of age.<BR>  <BR>  Adults may possess up to six marijuana plants, of which three or fewer are mature, flowering plants, as well as the marijuana harvested from the plants, provided that the plants are kept in an enclosed and locked space and are not grown openly or publicly. The marijuana harvested must remain on the premises where the plants were grown. Adults are also permitted to possess, use, display, purchase, and transport marijuana accessories that are used for the growth, manufacture, and consumption of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 64 states that its provisions are not intended to:<BR>  • allow driving under the influence of or while impaired by marijuana;<BR>  • permit underage access to or use of marijuana;<BR>  • affect the ability of an employer to restrict the use or  possession of marijuana by employees; or  • prevent a school, hospital, or other property owner from prohibiting or otherwise regulating the use, possession, growth, manufacture, or sale of marijuana on the property.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Regulation by the state.</B></I><BR> Amendment 64 requires the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) to adopt regulations by July 1, 2013, concerning licensing and security requirements for marijuana establishments, the prevention of marijuana sales to underage individuals, labeling requirements for marijuana products, health and safety standards for marijuana manufacturing, advertising restrictions, and civil penalties for violations. The measure specifies that the regulations may not prohibit marijuana establishments or make the operation of such establishments unreasonably impracticable.<BR>  <BR>  The DOR must also develop a schedule of application, licensing, and renewal fees. The application fees may not exceed $5,000, adjusted annually for inflation, unless the DOR determines that a greater fee is necessary. If a licensed medical marijuana business applies for a separate license created by the measure, the application fee may not exceed $500. The measure does not limit the amounts that may be charged for licensing and renewal fees. After the DOR receives a license application from a prospective marijuana establishment, it must forward the application and half of the application fee to the local government involved. The DOR must issue or deny the license within 90 days. If the DOR denies the license, it must notify the applicant in writing of its reason for doing so.<BR>  <BR>  In the event that the DOR does not adopt regulations by July 1, 2013, the measure states that marijuana establishment applicants may apply for an annual license with a local government. Applicants may only apply for a locally issued license after October 1, 2013, which is the deadline for local governments to identify which local agency will process marijuana license applications if necessary. Applicants may also apply for a locally issued license if the DOR adopts regulations but has not issued any licenses by January 1, 2014. While operating under a locally issued license, the marijuana establishments are not subject to regulation by the DOR.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Regulation by local governments.</B></I><BR> Local governments may enact regulations concerning the time, place, manner, and number of marijuana establishments in their community. In addition, local governments may prohibit the operation of marijuana establishments through an ordinance or a referred ballot measure; citizens may pursue such a prohibition through an initiated ballot measure. Even if marijuana establishments are prohibited by a local government, individuals in that community who are at least 21 years old may still possess, grow, and use marijuana as allowed by the measure.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Types of licenses.</B></I><BR>  Under Amendment 64, marijuana growth, processing, testing, and sales are authorized to be carried out by four types of regulated marijuana establishments. The measure directs the DOR to implement procedures for issuing, renewing, suspending, and revoking licenses for the establishments.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Taxes.</B></I><BR> This measure requires that the state legislature enact an excise tax. The current Colorado Constitution forbids a member of the state legislature to be bound to vote for or against any bill or measure pending or proposed to the state legislature. Because of this inherent conflict, the excise tax outlined in the measure might not be imposed. Additionally, this issue may result in significant litigation.<BR>  <BR>  Under the measure, marijuana is subject to existing state and local sales taxes and a new state excise tax to be set by the legislature. An excise tax is a tax on the use or consumption of certain products such as gasoline, alcohol, or cigarettes. The tax is generally collected at the wholesale level and passed on to consumers in the retail price. Marijuana cultivation facilities will pay the excise tax when selling marijuana to either marijuana product manufacturing facilities or to retail marijuana stores.<BR>  <BR>  Amendment 64 requires the legislature to enact the state excise tax; however, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) requires a separate statewide vote to approve the tax and any future tax increases. Under the measure, the excise tax is limited to 15 percent until January 1, 2017, when the legislature may set it at any rate. Each year, the first $40 million in revenue raised by the excise tax will be credited to a state fund used for constructing public schools. Medical marijuana is not subject to the state excise tax required by the measure, or to any existing state excise tax.<BR>  <BR>  <B><I>Effect on medical marijuana laws.</B></I><BR>  Amendment 64 does not change existing state medical marijuana laws, which allow Colorado citizens who have certain debilitating medical conditions to use medical marijuana. Medical marijuana patients and primary caregivers register with the state health agency, and businesses that grow, manufacture, and sell medical marijuana are regulated by the DOR and by local licensing authorities throughout the state. Medical marijuana patients are permitted to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and to grow up to six marijuana plants, with three or fewer being mature, flowering plants. Caregivers are subject to the same possession and  growth limitations as patients and may serve up to five patients.<BR>  <BR>  Under the measure, licensed medical marijuana cultivators, manufacturers, and dispensaries may apply for a separate marijuana establishment license, and are eligible for a reduced application fee.

636,Florida,2002,Excessive Punishments,"Proposing an amendment to the State Constitution identical to a proposed amendment to Section 17 of Article I of the State Constitution which was approved by a statewide vote in 1998. The Supreme Court of Florida struck the 1998 amendment in a ruling in which four of the seven justices found that the ballot summary was inaccurate. The proposed amendment expressly authorizes the death penalty for capital crimes and expressly authorizes retroactive changes in the method of execution. The amendment changes the prohibition against ""cruel or unusual punishment,"" currently provided in Section 17 of Article I of the State Constitution, to a prohibition against ""cruel and unusual punishment"" to conform with the wording of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment prohibits reduction of a death sentence based on invalidity of an execution method and provides for continued force of the sentence. The amendment permits any execution method unless prohibited by the United States Constitution. The amendment requires construction of the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment and the proposed prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment to conform to United States Supreme Court interpretation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment would prevent state courts, including the Florida Supreme Court, from treating the state constitutional prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment as being more expansive than the federal constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment or United States Supreme Court interpretations thereof. The amendment effectively nullifies rights currently allowed under the state prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment which may afford greater protections for those subject to punishment for crimes than will be provided by the amendment. Under the amendment, the protections afforded those subject to punishment for crimes under the ""cruel or unusual punishment"" clause, as that clause currently appears in Section 17 of Article I of the State Constitution, will be the same as the minimum protections provided under the ""cruel and unusual"" punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

It also would amend Article XII, Section 27, and add Sections 32 and 33, relating to the Schedule for the amendments.<BR>  <BR>  (2) In certain circumstances, the law requires the assessed value of homestead and specified nonhomestead property to increase when the just value of the property decreases. Therefore, this amendment provides that the Legislature may, by general law, provide that the assessment of homestead and specified nonhomestead property may not increase if the just value of that property is less than the just value of the property on the preceding January 1, subject to any adjustment in the assessed value due to changes, additions, reductions, or improvements to such property which are assessed as provided for by general law. This amendment takes effect upon approval by the voters. If approved at a special election held on the date of the 2012 presidential preference primary, it shall operate retroactively to January 1, 2012, or, if approved at the 2012 general election, shall take effect January 1, 2013.<BR>  <BR>  (3) This amendment reduces from 10 percent to 5 percent the limitation on annual changes in assessments of nonhomestead real property. This amendment takes effect upon approval of the voters.

The additional homestead exemption shall apply to all levies except school district levies. The additional exemption is an amount equal to 50 percent of the homestead property's just value on January 1 of the year the homestead is established. The additional homestead exemption may not exceed an amount equal to the median just value of all homestead property within the county where the property at issue is located for the calendar year immediately preceding January 1 of the year the homestead is established. The additional exemption shall apply for the shorter of 5 years or the year of sale of the property. The amount of the additional exemption shall be reduced in each subsequent year by an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the additional exemption received in the year the homestead was established or by an amount equal to the difference between the just value of the property and the assessed value of the property determined under Article VII, Section 4(d), whichever is greater. Not more than one such exemption shall be allowed per homestead property at one time. The additional exemption applies to property purchased on or after January 1, 2011, if approved by the voters at a special election held on the date of the 2012 presidential preference primary, or to property purchased on or after January 1, 2012, if approved by the voters at the 2012 general election. The additional exemption is not available in the sixth and subsequent years after it is first received. The amendment shall take effect upon approval by the voters. If approved at a special election held on the date of the 2012 presidential preference primary, it shall operate retroactively to January 1, 2012, or, if approved at the 2012 general election, takes effect January 1, 2013.<BR>  <BR>  (5) This amendment also delays until 2023, the repeal, currently scheduled to take effect in 2019, of constitutional amendments adopted in 2008 which limit annual assessment increases for specified nonhomestead real property. This amendment delays until 2022 the submission of an amendment proposing the abrogation of such repeal to the voters.<BR>  (HJR 381)",Amendment 4,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.43200000000000005,Amendment,0
677,Florida,2012,Religious Freedom,"Proposing an amendment to the State Constitution providing that no individual or entity may be denied, on the basis of religious identity or belief, governmental benefits, funding or other support, except as required by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and deleting the prohibition against using revenues from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect, or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution.",Amendment 8,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.445,Amendment,0
678,Florida,2012,State Courts,"Proposing a revision of Article V of the State Constitution relating to the judiciary. The State Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to adopt rules for the practice and procedure in all courts. The constitution further provides that a rule of court may be repealed by a general law enacted by a two-thirds vote of the membership of each house of the Legislature. This proposed constitutional revision eliminates the requirement that a general law repealing a court rule pass by a two-thirds vote of each house, thereby providing that the Legislature may repeal a rule of court by a general law approved by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature that expresses the policy behind the repeal. The court could readopt the rule in conformity with the public policy expressed by the Legislature, but if the Legislature determines that a rule has been readopted and repeals the readopted rule, this proposed revision prohibits the court from further readopting the repealed rule without the Legislature's prior approval. Under current law, rules of the judicial nominating commissions and the Judicial Qualifications Commission may be repealed by general law enacted by a majority vote of the membership of each house of the Legislature. Under this proposed revision, a vote to repeal those rules is changed to repeal by general law enacted by a majority vote of the legislators present. Under current law, the Governor appoints a justice of the Supreme Court from a list of nominees provided by a judicial nominating commission, and appointments by the Governor are not subject to confirmation. This revision requires Senate confirmation of a justice of the Supreme Court before the appointee can take office. If the Senate votes not to confirm the appointment, the judicial nominating commission must reconvene and may not renominate any person whose prior appointment to fill the same vacancy was not confirmed by the Senate. For the purpose of confirmation, the Senate may meet at any time. If the Senate fails to vote on the appointment of a justice within 90 days, the justice will be deemed confirmed and will take office. The Judicial Qualifications Commission is an independent commission created by the State Constitution to investigate and prosecute before the Florida Supreme Court alleged misconduct by a justice or judge. Currently under the constitution, commission proceedings are confidential until formal charges are filed by the investigative panel of the commission. Once formal charges are filed, the formal charges and all further proceedings of the commission are public. Currently, the constitution authorizes the House of Representatives to impeach a justice or judge. Further, the Speaker of the House of Representatives may request, and the Judicial Qualifications Commission must make available, all information in the commission's possession for use in deciding whether to impeach a justice or judge. This proposed revision requires the commission to make all of its files available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives but provides that such files would remain confidential during any investigation by the House of Representatives and until such information is used in the pursuit of an impeachment of a justice or judge. This revision also removes the power of the Governor to request files of the Judicial Qualifications Commission to conform to a prior constitutional change. This revision also makes technical and clarifying additions and deletions relating to the selection of chief judges of a circuit and relating to the Judicial Qualifications Commission, and makes other nonsubstantive conforming and technical changes in the judicial article of the constitution.<BR>  (HJR 7111)",Amendment 5,Legislative Referendum,Judiciary,General,0.37,Amendment,0

The Legislature may increase the state revenue limitation through a bill approved by a super majority vote of each house of the Legislature. The Legislature may also submit a proposed increase in the state revenue limitation to the voters. The Legislature must implement this proposed amendment by general law.

748,Georgia,2010,Allows Owners of Industrial-Zoned Property to Choose to Remove the Industrial Designation from their Property,"The proposal amends the provisions of the Constitution relating to industrial areas which exist in only two counties in the state.

Under this procedure local constitutional amendments were ratified in 1950 and 1956 creating industrial areas in Chatham County. Ga. Laws 1950, p. 444, and Ga. Laws 1956, p. 352. Under these constitutional amendments property in the industrial areas could never be annexed to any city, but any city could provide certain services and levy certain taxes in such areas. Under the local constitutional amendment procedure, the governing authorities of Jeff Davis County and its political subdivisions were also authorized to have a different type of industrial area in which they could exempt new industries from property taxes for a certain period of time. Ga. Laws 1963, p. 674.<BR>  <BR>  Under the current Georgia Constitution which took effect in 1983, new local constitutional amendments were prohibited, but certain prior local constitutional amendments, including those creating industrial areas, were continued in effect. Any modification in such industrial areas must now be carried out through a state-wide constitutional amendment.<BR>  <BR>  The current proposal would modify the conditions under which an owner of property in an industrial area may choose to remove the property from the industrial area. By a general constitutional amendment ratified in 1996 a property owner was authorized to remove the property, but only if the property was located on an island. Ga. Laws 1996, p. 1667. The current proposed amendment would remove the island limitation, so that any owner of property in an industrial area could choose to remove the property from the industrial area. Further, upon the filing of a removal certificate, the property shall be irrevocably annexed into the city which provides water services, or if none, then into the city that provides fire services.<BR>  <BR>  A copy of this entire proposed constitutional amendment is on file in the office of the judge of the probate court and is available for public inspection.",Constitutional Amendment 5,Legislative Referendum,Business & Commerce,General,0.635,Amendment,1

775,Hawaii,2002,"Assisting Not-for-Profit Private Schools, Colleges and Universities","The Hawaii Constitution presently allows the State to issue (sell) special purpose revenue bonds (SPRBs) to assist various entities. These include manufacturing, processing or industrial enterprises; utilities serving the general public; health care facilities provided to the general public by not-for-profit corporations; early childhood education and care facilities provided to the general public by not-for-profit corporations; and low and moderate income government housing programs.<BR>  <BR>  The Hawaii Constitution does not presently allow the State to issue SPRBs to assist not-for-profit private elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities. In addition, the Constitution does not allow the Legislature to appropriate the proceeds of SPRBs (money raised from the sale of the bonds) for the support or benefit of any sectarian (religious) or nonsectarian (secular) private educational institution.<BR>  <BR>  The ballot question asks voters to allow the State to issue SPRBs and use the proceeds from the bonds to assist not-for-profit private elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities. In addition, the question asks voters to allow the State to combine (""pool"") into a single issue of SPRBs two or more proposed issues of SPRBs to assist these not-for-profit private schools, colleges, and universities.<BR>  <BR>  A ""bond"" is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money (the principal amount) at a specified time in the future (the maturity date) and to periodically pay interest at a specified rate (the coupon rate), in return for a loan.<BR>  <BR>  If this amendment passes, then special purpose revenue bonds could be issued by the State in order to make funds available to private schools, at interest rates that are lower than the rates offered by commercial lenders.<BR>  <BR>  The State uses its tax-free bond issuing power to assist private schools so that the interest on what would otherwise be a taxable bond becomes free of income tax. Thus, a low interest rate on the borrowed money is obtained for the private schools.<BR>  <BR>  Special purpose revenue bonds are backed solely by the income of a revenue-producing enterprise (e.g., a private school). Special purpose revenue bonds are not backed by the ""full faith and credit"" (the full taxing and spending powers) of the State. The private schools, not the State, would be responsible to pay the bondholders. The costs of the bond issue would be paid by the private schools, as provided by law.<BR>  <BR>  A ""pool"" or ""pooled issue"" would allow a group of private schools to share the costs of a bond issue. It would make it possible for small schools to get together and participate in the bond issue.",Constitutional Amendment 2,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.597,Amendment,1
776,Hawaii,2002,Initiation of Felony Prosecutions by Written Information,"Article I, section 10, of the State Constitution requires that felony prosecutions be initiated in two ways: (1) by grand jury indictment or (2) upon the filing of a complaint following a preliminary hearing. Hearsay testimony is not allowed and probable cause must be established through the testimony of witnesses.<BR>  <BR>  This measure proposes to amend the Constitution to allow a third method of initiating a felony prosecution. This third method will allow the initiation of felony prosecutions by written information. This involves the submission to the court of a document, also known as a ""written information,"" that is similar to a complaint and that is supported by affidavits and other documentary evidence. If a judge finds probable cause based upon the written information, a warrant is issued and the case proceeds to trial. This method of initiating a felony prosecution is being used in ten other states.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment permits prosecutors and the Attorney General to initiate felony criminal charges by filing a written information signed by the prosecutor or the Attorney General setting forth the charge, in accordance with procedures and conditions to be provided by the State Legislature. The method of filing criminal felony charges through a written information will be in addition to the existing methods of grand jury indictments and preliminary hearings.",Constitutional Amendment 3,Legislative Referendum,Criminal Justice,General,0.573,Amendment,1
777,Hawaii,2002,Legislative Candidate Residency Requirements,"At present, while every candidate for the state legislature must be a qualified voter (and therefore a resident) of the district in which the candidate is seeking election, there is no time limit by when that candidate must become a resident. Theoretically, a candidate could do so on the day of the general election.<BR>  <BR>  It is relatively common for potential politicians to consider entering various House and Senate races in districts they do not reside if there is no incumbent. Under present law, a candidate could run in a primary from outside the district, win the primary over candidates who are residents, but not actually commit to moving into the district until the day of the general election.<BR>  <BR>  Under the proposed amendment a candidate for state senate or house of representatives must be a qualified voter, and therefore a resident, of his or her district before filing their nomination papers. Nomination papers can be filed any time between the first working day of February of the election year and sixty days before the primary. As the general election must be held not earlier than 45 days after the primary, a candidate who files at the earliest opportunity would be a resident of the district approximately nine months prior to the election, and a candidate who files at the latest possible opportunity would be a resident at least 105 days, or over three months, prior to the election.<BR>  <BR>  Because district boundaries often change after reapportionment, the amendment also allows incumbent legislators to move to a new district before the first primary election after reapportionment and still be able to keep their current seats (otherwise they would be disqualified for moving out of the district).<BR>  <BR>  This proposed amendment would not affect senate and representative candidates for Congress.",Constitutional Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.8390000000000001,Amendment,1

The Board of Regents is the governing board of the University of Hawaii system, which includes the respective University of Hawaii campuses (Manoa, Hilo, and West Oahu) as well as all of the community colleges. The Board of Regents has the power, as provided by law, to formulate policy and to exercise control over the University of Hawaii system through its executive officer, the president of the University, who is appointed by the Board of Regents. The Board of Regents also has exclusive jurisdiction over the internal structure, management, and operation of the University of Hawaii system.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed constitutional amendment would modify this selection process by requiring the Governor to nominate and appoint members from a pool of qualified candidates who have been screened and proposed by a Candidate Advisory Council for the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii, as provided by law.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment will not modify existing appointment and advice and consent provisions, requiring appointment by the Governor with the advice and consent of the State Senate. Additionally, the proposed amendment will not affect the terms of the existing members of the Board of Regents. The proposed constitutional amendment specifically indicates the Legislature's intent that the existing members of the Board of Regents be allowed to serve their full terms of office and be replaced only as each of their terms expires.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, members of the Board of Regents are nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the Hawaii State Senate, appointed by the Governor. The Governor has broad discretion to determine whom to appoint. The State Senate may refuse to confirm the appointment if it disapproves of the Governor's nominee.<BR>  <BR>  The composition, qualifications, and specific duties of members of the Candidate Advisory Council for the Board of Regents of the University of Hawaii would be determined by the Legislature by means of the legislative process when and if this constitutional amendment is adopted.",Constitutional Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Education: Higher Ed,General,0.562,Amendment,1
783,Hawaii,2006,Bonds for Assistance to Agricultural Enterprises,"Shall the State be authorized to issue special purpose revenue bonds and use the proceeds from the bonds to assist agricultural enterprises serving important agricultural lands?<BR>  <BR>  <B>Description of Proposed Amendment</B><BR>  The proposed amendment would authorize the State to issue special purpose revenue bonds to assist agricultural enterprises serving important agricultural lands.<BR>  <BR>  Special purpose revenue bonds are tax exempt and would allow agricultural enterprises to enjoy tax savings not available through other means of financing. Special purpose revenue bonds do not involve any state appropriation or expenditure and are not secured by the full faith and credit of the State.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the State Constitution allows the following entities to use special purpose revenue bonds:<BR>  1. Manufacturing, processing or industrial enterprises;<BR>  2. Utilities serving the general public;<BR>  3. Healthcare facilities;<BR>  4. Early childhood education and care facilities;<BR>  5. Low and moderate income government housing programs; and<BR>  6. Not-for-profit private nonsectarian and sectarian schools and colleges.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would add agricultural enterprises serving ""important agricultural lands"" to this list. The term important agricultural lands is defined under Act 183, Session Laws of Hawaii 2005, and generally means lands that:<BR>  1. Are capable of producing sustained high agricultural yields;<BR>  2. Contribute to the State's economic base; and<BR>  3. Are needed to promote the expansion of agricultural activities.<BR>  <BR>  The State's important agricultural lands, however, have not yet been identified. Pursuant to a state constitutionally mandated process of providing standards and criteria to ""conserve and protect agricultural lands [and] ... assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands,"" the State and the counties have recently undertaken a comprehensive and lengthy administrative process to identify important agricultural lands. The on-going process includes requiring the State or counties to identify eligible lands, creating appropriate land maps, providing an appeals process for farmers, inviting public input, and reclassifying eligible lands as necessary.",Constitutional Amendment 5,Legislative Referendum,Agriculture,General,0.637,Amendment,1

The proposed constitutional amendment would repeal this requirement. If the voters approve the proposed amendment, neither currently sitting justices and judges nor those appointed after the amendment takes effect would be required to retire at age seventy.<BR>  <BR>  Justices and judges would not be required to retire upon reaching any specific age. All justices and judges who wish to reapply to serve for an additional term must be found qualified to serve by the Judicial Selection Commission.",Constitutional Amendment 3,Legislative Referendum,Judiciary,General,0.348,Amendment,0
785,Hawaii,2006,Salary Commission,"Shall the Constitution be amended to provide for a salary commission to review and recommend salaries for justices, judges, state legislators, the governor, the lieutenant governor, the administrative director of the State, state department heads or executive officers of the executive departments, and the deputies or assistants to department heads of the executive departments, excluding the superintendent of education and the president of the University of Hawaii?<BR>  <BR>  <B>Description of Proposed Amendments</B><BR>  The proposed constitutional amendments would consolidate the present work of three separate salary commissions: the judicial salary commission, the commission on legislative salary, and the executive salary commission. Instead, a single salary commission would be established, as provided by law, to review and recommend salaries for judges, legislators, state officers, and high ranking state officials. By the fortieth day of the regular 2007 legislative session, and every six years thereafter, the commission would submit its recommendations to the Legislature and then dissolve.  Recommendations would become effective as provided in the recommendations unless the Legislature disapproves the entire recommendation as a whole by adopting a concurrent resolution prior to adjournment of the legislative session. Changes in salaries would not apply to the Legislature to which the recommendations were submitted. Once effective, the salaries could not be decreased during a term of office, unless by general law applying to all salaried officers of the State. The salaries of the Superintendent of Education and the President of the University of Hawaii would remain unaffected by the amendment.<BR>  <BR>  Under the proposed constitutional amendment, the provisions for the new single salary commission would be generally similar to those of the existing three separate salary commissions.",Constitutional Amendment 2,Legislative Referendum,Judiciary,General,0.528,Amendment,1
786,Hawaii,2006,Sexual Assault Crimes Against Minors,"Shall the Constitution of the State of Hawaii be amended to provide that in continuous sexual assault crimes against minors younger than fourteen years of age, the legislature may define:<BR>  (1) What behavior constitutes a continuing course of conduct; and<BR>  (2) What constitutes the jury unanimity that is required for a conviction?<BR>  <BR>  <B>Description of Proposed Amendment</B><BR>  The proposed amendment would add a section to the Hawaii Constitution specifying that, in continuous sexual assault crimes against minors less than fourteen years of age, the Legislature may define what behavior constitutes a ""continuing course of conduct"" and what constitutes the jury unanimity required for conviction in these cases. The Legislature previously defined ""continuing course of conduct"" in the crime of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years, section 707-733.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, as three or more acts of sexual penetration or sexual contact committed over a period of time. The Legislature also provided that the jury, to convict, need unanimously agree only that at least three acts of sexual penetration or sexual contact had been committed; the jury need not unanimously agree which specific acts constituted the three acts required by law.<BR>  <BR>  However, the Hawaii Supreme Court held in 2003 that multiple acts of sexual penetration or sexual contact were, ""by nature, separate and discrete and therefore may not form the basis of a continuing offense."" State v. Rabago, 103 Hawaii 236, 253, 81 P.3d 1151, 1168 (2003). Furthermore, the court ruled that letting the jury convict without being unanimous as to which specific acts constituted the three acts required by law violated state constitutional guarantees of due process.<BR>  <BR>  If the voters approve the proposed constitutional amendment, substantially the same language previously codified in section 707-733.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and found unconstitutional by the Hawaii Supreme Court would be reenacted pursuant to Act 60, Session Laws of Hawaii 2006. The criminal offense created by that legislation would be a class A felony. Felony offenses are those punishable by more than one year in prison. There are three classes of felonies, A, B, and C, with A felonies being the most serious of these. Murder, an unclassified felony, is the most serious of all felonies.",Constitutional Amendment 4,Legislative Referendum,Criminal Justice,General,0.69,Amendment,1

Similar constitutional amendments were approved by the House (HCR 5015) during the 2008 Session; and by the Senate (SCR 1602) during the 2009 Session.<BR>  <BR>  A proposed constitutional amendment (SCR 1629) placed on the 2000 general election ballot that would have authorized new tax treatment for both watercraft and aircraft was defeated by less than 12,000 votes (433,499 ""no"" to 421,621 ""yes"").<BR>  <BR>  After a similar legislative authorization for ""recreational vehicles"" was adopted as part of a constitutional amendment in 1992, the Kansas Legislature in 1994 subsequently availed itself of that prerogative and enacted a new tax system for such vehicles under which liability since January 1, 1995, has been based on the weight and the age of the vehicles (rather than on fair market value.)itself of that prerogative and enacted a new tax system for such vehicles under which liability since January 1, 1995, has been based on the weight and the age of the vehicles (rather than on fair market value.)<BR>  <BR>  Data provided by the Department of Revenue indicated that in tax year 2010, watercraft comprised $89.4 million of assessed valuation statewide ($298.0 million of appraised valuation). State taxation of these watercraft generated about $1.79 million in local effort for purposes of the school finance formula (20 mills) and $0.13 million for state building funds (1.5 mills).<BR>  <BR>  Even if it were to be adopted by voters, HCR 5017 would have no immediate fiscal impact unless and until the Legislature passed a law that changed the tax treatment of  watercraft.",HCR 5017,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.536,Amendment,1
855,Kansas,2014,Proposal to Authorize Raffles,"Sub. for SCR 1618 submits a state constitutional amendment for consideration at the  next general election in November 2014. The amendment, if approved by voters, will allow  charitable raffles by certain nonprofit organizations.  The proposal will amend Section 3 of Article 15 in the Kansas Constitution to permit  “raffles” if authorized by the Legislature. The amendment will allow the Legislature to authorize  the licensing, conduct, and regulation of charitable raffles by nonprofit, religious, charitable,  fraternal, educational, or veterans organizations.   “Raffle” is defined in the proposed amendment to mean a game of chance in which each  participant buys a ticket or tickets from one of the above mentioned organizations, with each  ticket providing an equal chance to win a prize and the winner being determined by a random  drawing. The following limitations also are included in the constitutional amendment:  ● An organization shall not be able to use an electronic gaming or vending  machine to sell tickets or conduct raffles;  ● An organization shall not contract with a professional raffle or other lottery vendor  for the management, operation, or conduct of any raffle; and  ● Raffles shall be licensed and regulated by the Office of Charitable Gaming, in the  Department of Revenue, or by a successor agency.  (Note: Section 3 of Article 15 of the Kansas Constitution prohibits lotteries and the sale  of lottery tickets. Voters previously approved three amendments to Section 3, allowing  exceptions for bingo (Section 3a. in 1974), parimutuel wagering (Section 3b. in 1986), and a  state-owned and -operated lottery (Section 3c. in 1986).

862,Kentucky,2002,Family Court Amendment,"Are you in favor of family courts in Kentucky by amending the Kentucky Constitution to allow the Supreme Court to designate a division of circuit court as a family court?<BR>  <BR>  Constitutional Changes Proposed by the Amendment<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the Kentucky Constitution provides for District and Circuit Courts, Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The Constitution divides the jurisdiction of the courts, stating that the District Court is a trial court of limited jurisdiction and the Circuit Court is a trial court  of general jurisdiction. However, there is no provision for creating special courts within the District or the Circuit Courts with particular jurisdictions. While Kentucky currently has several family courts operating throughout the  state, a Supreme Court case denotes these family courts as ""pilot projects"" because there is no Constitutional provision specifically authorizing their creation. The proposed constitutional amendment would permit the chief justice of the Supreme Court to create a family court division within this highest level of the trial courts in Kentucky, the Circuit Court. A Circuit Court division designated as a Family Court would then have the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and any additional jurisdiction that is provided by the General Assembly in law. This would give the pilot family court projects a permanent legal status, should the Chief Justice choose to retain family courts.<BR>  <BR>  Effective Date<BR>  <BR>  If the voters approve the proposed family court amendment on November 5, its provisions will take effect immediately.",Constitutional Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.76,,1

The operation of slot machines must be approved by the municipality in which the tribal commercial track is located before the Gambling Control Board may grant a license to operate slot machines to a person licensed to operate that tribal commercial track.

Although there are four federally recognized tribes in Maine, only two (the Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe) have reservations as defined in chapter 601.  A tribal commercial track also would have to conduct racing on more than 25 days each calendar year after being licensed by the Maine Harness Racing Commission to conduct harness racing.<BR>  <BR>  In order to obtain a license to operate slot machines at a ""tribal commercial track,"" the applicant would have to receive approval, on or before December 31, 2007, of either the governing body of the municipality in which the track is to be located (e.g., the town council, board of selectmen, or city council), or the voters of that municipality voting at a referendum election. The licensing and operation of slot machines at a tribal commercial track would be regulated by the State Gambling Control Board.<BR>  <BR>  Revenues from the slot machines would be distributed according to the statutory formula currently applicable to commercial tracks, with the following variations:<BR>  <BR>  - the allocations to fund scholarships at the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System would be dedicated to the campuses in Washington County;<BR>  - an additional 1% of the total gross slot machine income from the tribal commercial track would be distributed to the Washington County Development Authority;<BR>  - and an additional 1% would go to the career and technical education centers located in Washington County.<BR>  <BR>  The Act would also authorize the Chief of the State Police to issue a high-stakes beano license to a federally recognized Indian tribe to operate games on non-tribal land in Washington County.

1079,Maine,2010,"People's Veto of P.L. 2009, c. 382 “An Act To Implement Tax Relief and Tax Reform""","Scheduled to appear on June 8, 2010 primary ballot.<BR>  Do you want to reject the new law that lowers Maine's income tax and replaces that revenue by making changes to the sales tax?<BR>  <BR>  <B>Intent and Content</B><BR>  Prepared by the Office of the Attorney General<BR>  <BR>  This referendum question asks whether Maine voters want to reject legislation enacted by the Legislature and approved by the Governor in June 2009 that reforms the state's income tax structure, broadens the base of the sales tax, and amends the Circuit Breaker Program as follows:<BR>  <BR>  Part A of the legislation replaces the four existing marginal tax rates (which range from 2% on taxable income below $4,200, up to 8.5% of taxable income over $16,700) with a flat rate of 6.5% of Maine taxable income. Taxpayers with taxable income of more than $250,000 would pay, in addition, an income tax surcharge of 0.35% on their Maine taxable income above $250,000.<BR>  <BR>  The legislation also replaces the current system of standard and itemized deductions with several new tax credits. Tax credits are subtracted from the amount of taxes owed, as compared to deductions, which are subtracted from the amount of taxable income to which the tax rate applies. The principal credit is a refundable household credit for individuals who are full-time Maine residents. The base amount of this credit ranges from $700 for single individuals to $1,200 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and the credit increases by $250 with each exemption that the taxpayer is allowed to claim on their federal income tax return.<BR>  <BR>  The legislation also provides a credit for charitable contributions of more than $250,000 claimed on a federal income tax return, and a credit for taxpayers who are 65 years or older. The existing earned income tax credit would be retained and made refundable. Refundable tax credits allow for a refund to the taxpayer (up to a maximum amount specified in the law) if the amount of the credit exceeds the amount of tax due.<BR>  <BR>  Both the alternative minimum tax and the alternative minimum tax credit would be repealed for individuals but maintained for corporations. Taxes on lump-sum retirement plan distributions and on early distributions from qualified retirement plans would be repealed. The retirement and disability tax credit and the low-income tax credit would also be repealed.<BR>  <BR>  Part B of the legislation applies the existing 5% sales tax, for the first time, to several categories of services, including many amusement, entertainment and recreational services; installation, repair and maintenance services; personal property services (such as dry cleaning, laundry services, vehicle towing, moving, house cleaning, picture framing, and pet services); transportation and courier services; and long distance telephone service. It would add an airport transportation fee of $1 per passenger for taxicab and limousine service to or from the airport. The sales tax rate on certain items would increase as follows: on meals, lodging, and liquor served in bars, restaurants and other licensed establishments, from 7% to 8.5%; on candy, from 5% to 8.5%; and on automobile rentals of less than one year, from 10% to 12.5%.<BR>  <BR>  Part C of the legislation makes certain changes to broaden the scope of the Maine Residents Property Tax and Rent Refund ""Circuit Breaker"" Program. This Program provides partial refunds of property taxes and rent paid by residents with household incomes below certain levels. This legislation repeals the 10-acre limit on the size of the homeowner's or renter's house lot. It also excludes from the calculation of household income (for eligibility purposes) the income of dependents in the household, cash inheritances, and the nontaxable portion of certain other types of income that do not exceed $5,000.<BR>  <BR>  After the legislation making the above changes was enacted in June 2009, petitioners collected enough signatures of registered voters to refer it to the people for a vote at a statewide election. The legislation has been suspended pending the outcome of this election.<BR>  <BR>  A ""YES"" vote would reject the new law and keep the current tax laws unchanged.<BR>  <BR>  A ""NO"" vote would allow the new law to take effect, including all of the above-described changes.",Question 1,Popular Referendum,Tax & Revenue,Primary,0.608,Statutory,1

Current law requires the commercial track to be located at or within a 5-mile radius of the center of a commercial track that conducted harness racing with pari-mutuel wagering on more than 25 days during calendar year 2002 and requires the referendum to have been held before December 31, 2003.<BR>  <BR>  The initiated bill changes the definition of ""commercial track"" to include a harness horse racing track licensed to conduct harness horse racing with pari-mutuel wagering that is owned and operated by one or more federally recognized Indian tribes located in this State, is located more than 90 miles from the nearest existing commercial track that operates slot machines, is within 45 miles of the operating tribe's Indian reservation and conducts racing on more than 25 days each calendar year after having been granted a license to conduct harness horse racing.<BR>  <BR>  The initiated bill provides that a license to operate slot machines at a commercial track may not be denied on the basis of the proximity of the commercial track to any other gambling facility if the commercial track was licensed and operating before the other gambling facility was licensed, unless the commercial track proposes to relocate or has relocated closer to the other gambling facility after the other facility was licensed and operating.<BR>  <BR>  The initiated bill permits the Gambling Control Board to allow an additional 1,500 slot machines to be registered for each commercial track at which slot machines were not operated prior to January 1, 2010 and at which the operation of slot machines is licensed after January 1, 2010.

1084,Maine,2011,Redistricting,"Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to change the years of redistricting the Maine Legislature, congressional districts and county commissioner districts after 2013 from 2023 and every 10th year thereafter to 2021 and every 10th year thereafter?<BR>  <BR>  <B>Intent and Content</B><BR>  This proposal would amend Maine's Constitution to more closely align the time frames for reapportioning electoral districts for federal, state and county offices with the federal census. It would also make the process for reapportionment of congressional and county commissioner districts part of the Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Maine's Constitution currently provides that legislative districts must be reapportioned based on census data every ten years, starting in 1983. This means that redistricting occurs in the third year after the federal decennial census. The proposed constitutional amendment would move the year of redistricting up to the first year following the census, meaning that redistricting based on the 2020 federal census would be accomplished in 2021 (instead of in 2023) and every ten years thereafter.<BR>  <BR>Under the amendment, the apportionment commission established under the Constitution would have until June 1st of that year in which to submit a plan to the Legislature for reapportioning legislative districts. The Legislature would be required to enact either that plan or its own plan by June 11th.<BR>  <BR>  All other aspects of reapportionment for legislative districts would remain as currently written in the Constitution. These include the requirements that a plan be enacted by a two-thirds vote of each legislative body and that if the Legislature fails to adopt a plan by the June 11 deadline, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court shall make the apportionment.<BR>  <BR>  The process for reapportioning congressional districts and county commissioner districts currently exists only in statute. This amendment would incorporate those procedures into Maine's Constitution. The same commission established to reapportion legislative districts would also be required to submit an apportionment plan for congressional and county commissioner districts to the Legislature by June 1st of 2021 and every ten years thereafter. The Legislature would have until June 11th of that year to enact the commission’s plan or its own plan for the congressional districts. The schedule would be slightly different for county commissioner districts.<BR>  <BR>  The Clerk of the House of Representatives would be required to submit the commission's plan for county commissioner districts to the Legislature, in the form of a legislative document, by no later than January 15, 2022 (and every 10th year thereafter). The Legislature would then have to enact that proposal or its own plan within 30 days.<BR>  <BR>  All of the other procedures and substantive standards that are currently set forth in statute for reapportioning congressional and county commissioner districts would be inserted into the Constitution under this amendment. These include the requirements that a reapportionment plan must be enacted by a two-thirds vote of each legislative body, and that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court shall make the apportionment if the Legislature fails to adopt a plan by its deadline.

For a primary, general or special election held on a Tuesday, this means the voter would have to register to vote in person at the municipal office no later than the close of business on the Thursday before election day. (Voters also may register to vote by submitting an application by mail or through a 3rd person, including a social service or motor vehicle agency, provided the municipal office receives the application by the close of business on the 21st day prior to the election. Chapter 399 does not change this provision of existing law.) A voter who is already registered to vote in the municipality but who has moved to a new address within the municipality would still be allowed to change that registration address on or before election day.<BR>  <BR>  Chapter 399 also establishes a procedure for provisional voting, which enables a person to cast a provisional ballot on election day if the person's name is not on the incoming voting list in the municipality but the person declares that he or she is a registered voter in that municipality and eligible to vote in a federal election. In order to obtain a provisional ballot, the voter must make a sworn statement to this effect and must show proof of identity and current residency in that municipality. (Under existing law, a voter in such circumstances would be allowed to register to vote on election day and cast a regular ballot.) A provisional ballot is counted as a regular ballot if the municipal clerk or registrar is able to confirm the voter's eligibility to vote in that jurisdiction no later than three business days after the election.<BR>  <BR>  After the legislation making the above changes was enacted in June 2011, petitioners collected a sufficient number of signatures of registered voters to refer certain sections of the legislation to the people for a vote at a statewide election.

This power may be exercised only as prescribed by law or rule.<BR>  <BR>  District Court commissioners are judicial officers appointed by the administrative judges of the District Court, subject to the approval of the Chief Judge of the District Court. Commissioners' powers are limited by the Constitution to issuing arrest warrants and setting terms for pre-trial release pending hearing in criminal cases, including terms for bail or collateral.<BR>  <BR>  Current law requires one or more commissioners to be available in each county, at all times, for the convenience of the public and police.<BR>  <BR>  Under the current domestic violence law, a ""person eligible for relief"" may seek relief from abuse by filing a petition with the District Court or a circuit court. Persons eligible for relief include the current or former spouse of the respondent (the alleged abuser), an individual who has a child in common with the respondent, and certain individuals who are related to or who reside or have resided with the respondent. If the court finds that abuse has occurred, the court may issue a ""protective order"" ordering the respondent to refrain from committing or threatening abuse. Some of the other types of relief available in a protective order include: ordering the respondent to end all contact with the victim; ordering the respondent to stay away from the victim's home, place of employment, or school; awarding temporary use and possession of the home to the victim; and awarding temporary custody of children to the victim.<BR>  <BR>  Individuals who do not qualify as a ""person eligible for relief"" under the domestic violence law may seek protection from another individual by filing a petition for a ""peace order"" with the District Court. If the court finds that the respondent has committed, and is likely to commit in the future, a prohibited act (an act that causes serious bodily harm, an act that places the petitioner in fear of imminent serious bodily harm, an assault, a rape or sexual offense, an attempted rape or sexual offense, false imprisonment, harassment, stalking, trespass, or malicious destruction of property) against the petitioner, the court may issue a peace order. The respondent may be ordered to refrain from committing or threatening to commit a prohibited act, end all contact with the petitioner, and stay away from the petitioner's home, place of employment, or school.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, domestic violence protective orders and peace orders may only be issued by a judge. Generally, these orders are only issued during business hours. The effect of this constitutional amendment would be to allow individuals to seek protective orders and peace orders when the courts are closed.<BR>  <BR>  During the 2002 session, the General Assembly also passed companion legislation (Chapter 235) making the changes to statutory law necessary to implement this constitutional amendment. That legislation, which will only take effect if the amendment is ratified, establishes procedures for the issuance of interim protective orders and peace orders by District Court commissioners. Under the legislation, an interim order is effective only until the earlier of a hearing held by a judge or the end of the second business day the District Court is open after the issuance of the interim order.",Question 1,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.8759999999999999,Amendment,1

An emergency bill is a bill that is declared necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety and is passed by the General Assembly by a vote of three-fifths of the elected membership of each house. An emergency bill may take effect immediately upon approval by the Governor or at a specified date before June 1. There are several classes of legislation that the constitution prohibits from being enacted as emergency legislation: measures that create or abolish any office; change the salary, term, or duties of any officer; grant a franchise or special privilege; or create any vested right or interest.<BR>  <BR>  This constitutional amendment proposes removing the limitation on the authority of the General Assembly to pass emergency laws creating or abolishing any office or changing the term or duties of any officer.",Question 2,Legislative Referendum,Legislatures,General,0.507,Amendment,1

Generally, in proceedings initiated by the State or a local government for the taking of private property, known as condemnation proceedings, compensation as agreed upon by the parties or awarded by a jury must be paid or tendered to the owner before the property may be taken. There are, however, exceptions in the constitution, commonly referred to as ""quick take"" authority, that allow the immediate taking of private property located in Baltimore City, Baltimore and Montgomery Counties, and the municipalities in Cecil County upon payment of the estimated fair market value of the property to the owner or into court. If a jury later awards a higher amount, the local government must pay the difference.<BR>  <BR>  In Montgomery County, this quick take authority is limited to unimproved property (meaning that the property does not include any buildings). Further, the County Council must find that there is an immediate need for the property for right of way for county roads or streets. Currently, Article III, Section 40A of the Maryland Constitution authorizes the County Council to appoint a licensed real estate broker to estimate the property's fair market value. This proposal amends Section 40A to authorize the County Council to appoint either a licensed real estate broker or a licensed and certified real estate appraiser to estimate the fair market value of property that will be taken for public use under the county's quick take authority.<BR>  <BR>  Since 1991, an individual must be licensed or certified by the State Commission of Real Estate Appraisers to perform most types of real estate appraisals in Maryland. Real estate brokers are licensed by the State Real Estate Commission. A broker's license entitles the holder to provide real estate brokerage services in the State, which include the buying, selling, and leasing of real estate. Most licensed brokers are not also licensed or certified as appraisers; therefore, Montgomery County has experienced difficulty in identifying licensed real estate brokers who are also properly qualified as appraisers to estimate the fair market value of property for purposes of its quick take process.",Question 3,Legislative Referendum,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.596,Amendment,1

The amendment provides that a party in a circuit court trial conducted by less than three circuit court judges is eligible for in banc review. The amendment establishes that three judges of a circuit court constitute a circuit court in banc. The amendment repeals thr authority of the circuit courts to regulate the rules governing in banc circuit court appeals, and establishes that the Maryland Rules are to provide the procedure for such appeals.

In the program, all books and nearly all teaching would be in English, with the curriculum designed for children learning English, although a teacher could use a minimal amount of a child's native language when necessary.  Schools would be encouraged to place in the same classroom children who are from different native-language groups but who have the same level of English skills.  Once a student is able to do regular schoolwork in English, the student would be transferred to an English language mainstream classroom.  These requirements would not affect special education programs for physically or mentally impaired students or foreign language classes for children who already know English.<BR>  <BR>  Parents or guardians of certain children could apply each year to have the requirements waived, so as to place their child in bilingual education or other classes, if the parents or guardians visit the school to be informed, in a language they can understand, about all available options.  To obtain a waiver, the child must either (1) already know English; or (2) be at least 10 years old, and the school principal and staff believe that another course of study would be better for the child's educational progress and rapid learning of English; or (3) have special physical or psychological needs (other than lack of English skills), have already spent 30 days in an English language classroom during that school year, the school principal and staff document their belief that the child's special needs make another course of study better for the child's educational progress and rapid learning of English, and the school superintendent approves the waiver.  If 20 or more students in one grade level at a school receive waivers, the school would have to offer either bilingual education classes providing instruction in both the student's native language and English or classes using other generally recognized educational methodologies permitted by law.  In other cases, a student receiving a waiver would have to be allowed to transfer to a school offering such classes.<BR>  <BR>  A parent or guardian could sue to enforce the proposed law and, if successful, would receive attorney's fees, costs and compensatory money damages.  Any school employee, school committee member or other elected official or administrator who willfully and repeatedly refused to implement the proposed law could be personally ordered to pay such fees, costs, and damages; could not be reimbursed for that payment by any public or private party; and could not be elected to a school committee or employed in the public schools for 5 years.  Parents or guardians of a child who received a waiver based on special needs could sue if, before the child reaches age 18, they discover that the application for a waiver was induced by fraud or intentional misrepresentation and injured the child's education.<BR>  <BR>  All English learners in grades kindergarten and up would take annual standardized tests of English skills.  All English learners in grades 2 and up would take annual written standardized tests, in English, of academic subjects.  Severely learning disabled students could be exempted from the tests.  Individual scores would be released only to parents, but aggregate scores, school and school district rankings, the number of English learners in each school and district, and related data would be made public.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would provide, subject to the state Legislature's appropriation, $5 million each year for 10 years for school committees to provide free or low-cost English language instruction to adults who pledged to tutor English learners.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would replace the current law, under which a school committee must establish a transitional bilingual education program for any 20 or more enrolled children of the same language group who cannot do ordinary classwork in English and whose native language is not English or whose parents do not speak English.  In that program, schools must teach all required courses in both English and the child's native language; teach both the native language and English; and teach the history and culture of both the native land of the child's parents and the United States.  Teaching or non-required subjects may be in a language other than English, and for subjects where verbalization is not essential (such as art or music), the child must participate in regular classes with English-speaking students.<BR>  <BR>  Under the current law, a child stays in the program for 3 years or until the child can perform successfully in English-only classes, whichever occurs first.  A test of the child's English skills is given each year.  A school committee may not transfer a child out of the program before the third year unless the parents approve and the child has received an English-skills test score appropriate to the child's grade level.  A child may stay in the program longer than 3 years if the school committee and the parent or guardian approve.  Parents must be informed of their child's enrollment in the program and have the right to withdraw their child from the program.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law's testing requirements would govern all school years beginning after the proposed law's effective date.

Parts of the state's public employee labor relations law and regulations would apply to the election and collective bargaining processes. The proposed law would not authorize providers to engage in a strike or other refusal to deliver child care services.<BR>  <BR>  An exclusive representative, if certified, could then communicate with providers to develop and present a proposal to the state agencies concerning the terms and conditions of child care provider services. The proposed law would then require the parties to negotiate in good faith to try to reach a binding agreement. If the agreed-upon terms and conditions required changes in existing regulations, the state agencies could not finally agree to the terms until they completed the required procedures for changing regulations and any cost items agreed to by the parties had been approved by the state Legislature. If any actions taken under the proposed law required spending state funds, that spending would be subject to appropriation by the Legislature. Any complaint that one of the parties was refusing to negotiate in good faith could be filed with and ruled upon by the Labor Relations Commission. An exclusive representative could collect a fee from providers for the costs of representing them.<BR>  <BR>  An exclusive representative could be de-certified under Commission regulations and procedures if certain conditions were met. The Commission could not accept a decertification petition for at least 2 years after the first exclusive representative was certified, and any such petition would have to be supported by 50% or more of the total number of providers. The Commission would then hold a secret mail ballot election for the providers to vote on whether to decertify the exclusive representative.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law states that activities carried out under it would be exempt from federal anti-trust laws.

The requirement applies to candidates for nomination for statewide office, representative in Congress, governor's councillor, member of the state Legislature, district attorney, clerk of court, register of probate, register of deeds, county commissioner, sheriff, and county treasurer. The proposed law would also allow any person to appear on the primary ballot as a candidate for a party's nomination for those offices if the party's state committee gave its written consent. The proposed law would also repeal the existing requirement that in order to be nominated to appear as an unenrolled candidate on the state election ballot, or on any city or town ballot following a primary, a person cannot have been enrolled in any political party during the 90 days before the deadline for filing nomination papers.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would provide that if a candidate were nominated by more than one party or political designation, instead of the candidate's name being printed on the ballot once, with the candidate allowed to choose the order in which the party or political designation names appear after the candidate's name, the candidate's name would appear multiple times, once for each nomination received. The candidate would decide the order in which the party or political designation nominations would appear, except that all parties would be listed before all political designations. The ballot would allow voters who vote for a candidate nominated by multiple parties or political designations to vote for that candidate under the party or political designation line of their choice.<BR>  <BR>  If a voter voted for the same candidate for the same office on multiple party or political designation lines, the ballot would remain valid but would be counted as a single vote for the candidate on a line without a party or political designation. If voting technology allowed, voting machines would be required to prevent a voter from voting more than the number of times permitted for any one office.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would provide that if a candidate received votes under more than one party or political designation, the votes would be combined for purposes of determining whether the candidate had won the election.

Holders of licenses to sell wine at food stores could sell wine either on its own or together with any other items they sell.<BR>  <BR>  The licensing authorities in any city or town of up to 5000 residents could issue up to 5 licenses for food stores to sell wine. In cities or towns of over 5000 residents, one additional license could be issued for each additional 5000 residents (or fraction of 5000). No person or business could hold more than 10% of the total number of the licenses that could be issued under the proposed law. Such licenses would not be counted when applying the laws that limit the number of other kinds of alcoholic beverage licenses that may be issued or held. Any applicant for a license would have to be approved by the state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and any individual applicant would have to be at least 21 years old and not have been convicted of a felony.<BR>  <BR>  In issuing any licenses for food stores to sell wine, local licensing authorities would have to use the same procedures that apply to other licenses for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages. Except where the proposed law has different terms, the same laws that apply to issuance, renewal, suspension and termination of licenses for retail sales of alcoholic beverages which are not to be consumed on the seller's premises, and that apply to the operations of holders of such licenses, would govern licenses to sell wine at food stores, and the operation of holders of such licenses.

Offenders age 18 or older would be subject to forfeiture of the marijuana plus a civil penalty of $100.  Offenders under the age of 18 would be subject to the same forfeiture and, if they complete a drug awareness program within one year of the offense, the same $100 penalty.<BR>  <BR>  Offenders under 18 and their parents or legal guardian would be notified of the offense and the option for the offender to complete a drug awareness program developed by the state Department of Youth Services.  Such programs would include ten hours of community service and at least four hours of instruction or group discussion concerning the use and abuse of marijuana and other drugs and emphasizing early detection and prevention of substance abuse.<BR>  <BR>  The penalty for offenders under 18 who fail to complete such a program within one year could be increased to as much as $1,000, unless the offender showed an inability to pay, an inability to participate in such a program, or the unavailability of such a program.  Such an offender's parents could also be held liable for the increased penalty.

The repeal would take effect on January 1, 2011, but would not stop or otherwise affect any proposed housing that had already received both a comprehensive permit and a building permit for at least one unit.<BR>  <BR>  Under the existing law, the ZBA holds a public hearing on the application and considers the recommendations of local agencies and officials.  The ZBA may grant a comprehensive permit that may include conditions or requirements concerning the height, site plan, size, shape, or building materials of the housing.  Persons aggrieved by the ZBA's decision to grant a permit may appeal it to a court.  If the ZBA denies the permit or grants it with conditions or requirements that make the housing uneconomic to build or to operate, the applicant may appeal to the state Housing Appeals Committee (HAC).<BR>  <BR>  After a hearing, if the HAC rules that the ZBA's denial of a comprehensive permit was unreasonable and not consistent with local needs, the HAC orders the ZBA to issue the permit.  If the HAC rules that the ZBA's decision issuing a comprehensive permit with conditions or requirements made the housing uneconomic to build or operate and was not consistent with local needs, the HAC orders the ZBA to modify or remove any such condition or requirement so as to make the proposal no longer uneconomic.  The HAC cannot order the ZBA to issue any permit that would allow the housing to fall below minimum safety standards or site plan requirements.  If the HAC rules that the ZBA's action was consistent with local needs, the HAC must uphold it even if it made the housing uneconomic.  The HAC's decision is subject to review in the courts.<BR>  <BR>  A condition or requirement makes housing ""uneconomic"" if it would prevent a public agency or non-profit organization from building or operating the housing except at a financial loss, or it would prevent a limited dividend organization from building or operating the housing without a reasonable return on its investment.<BR>  <BR>  A ZBA's decision is ""consistent with local needs"" if it applies requirements that are reasonable in view of the regional need for low- and moderate-income housing and the number of low-income persons in the city or town, as well as the need to protect health and safety, promote better site and building design, and preserve open space, if those requirements are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing.

The patient would also have to obtain a written certification, from a physician with whom the patient has a bona fide physician-patient relationship, that the patient has a specific debilitating medical condition and would likely obtain a net benefit from medical use of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would allow patients to possess up to a 60-day supply of marijuana for their personal medical use. The state Department of Public Health (DPH) would decide what amount would be a 60-day supply. A patient could designate a personal caregiver, at least 21 years old, who could assist with the patient's medical use of marijuana but would be prohibited from consuming that marijuana. Patients and caregivers would have to register with DPH by submitting the physician's certification.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would allow for non-profit medical marijuana treatment centers to grow, process and provide marijuana to patients or their caregivers.

In 2013, there could be no more than 35 treatment centers, with at least one but not more than five centers in each county. In later years, DPH could modify the number of centers.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would require DPH to issue a cultivation registration to a qualifying patient whose access to a treatment center is limited by financial hardship, physical inability to access reasonable transportation, or distance. This would allow the patient or caregiver to grow only enough plants, in a closed, locked facility, for a 60-day supply of marijuana for the patient's own use.<BR>  <BR>  DPH could revoke any registration for a willful violation of the proposed law.

At the time of the second request, the physician would have to offer the patient an opportunity to rescind the request. The patient would also have to sign a standard form, in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom is not a relative, a beneficiary of the patient's estate, or an owner, operator, or employee of a health care facility where the patient receives treatment or lives.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would require the attending physician to: (1) determine if the patient is qualified; (2) inform the patient of his or her medical diagnosis and prognosis, the potential risks and probable result of ingesting the medication, and the feasible alternatives, including comfort care, hospice care and pain control; (3) refer the patient to a consulting physician for a diagnosis and prognosis regarding the patient's disease, and confirmation in writing that the patient is capable, acting voluntarily, and making an informed decision; (4) refer the patient for psychiatric or psychological consultation if the physician believes the patient may have a disorder causing impaired judgment; (5) recommend that the patient notify next of kin of the patient's intention; (6) recommend that the patient have another person present when the patient ingests the medicine and to not take it in a public place; (7) inform the patient that he or she may rescind the request at any time; (8) write the prescription when the requirements of the law are met, including verifying that the patient is making an informed decision; and (9) arrange for the medicine to be dispensed directly to the patient, or the patient's agent, but not by mail or courier.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed law would make it punishable by imprisonment and/or fines, for anyone to (1) coerce a patient to request medication, (2) forge a request, or (3) conceal a rescission of a request.

1209,Michigan,2002,"A Proposed Constitutional Amendment to Reallocate the ""Tobacco Settlement Revenue"" Received by the State from Cigarette Manufacturers","The proposed constitutional amendment would:<BR>  <BR>  1.  Annually allocate on a permanent basis 90% (approximately $297 million) of tobacco settlement revenue received by state from cigarette manufacturers as follows: $151.8 million to nonprofit hospitals, licensed nursing homes, licensed hospices, nurse practitioners, school-linked health centers and Healthy Michigan Foundation; $102.3 million to fund programs to reduce tobacco use, Health and Aging Research Development Initiative, Tobacco-Free Futures Fund, Council of Michigan Foundations and Nurses Scholarship Program; and $42.9 million to the Elder Prescription Drug Program.<BR>  <BR>  2.  Guarantee recipients funding at 2001 appropriation levels plus additional state funds on an escalating basis for nonprofit hospitals, licensed nursing homes, licensed hospices and nurse practitioners.<BR>  <BR>  House Fiscal Agency Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Proposal 02-4, the tobacco settlement revenue ballot proposal, would amend Article IX, section 36 of the Michigan Constitution to specify how tobacco settlement revenue received by the state is allocated. If passed, it would permanently require that 90% of the tobacco settlement revenue received by Michigan each year be allocated for certain health care-related purposes. In the FY 2002-03 state budget, $215.7 million in tobacco settlement revenue is appropriated for various programs and initiatives, including the Merit Award Scholarship program, that do not meet the requirements of the ballot proposal. If additional revenue is not available, expenditure reductions of this amount would be required.<BR>  <BR>  Proposal 02-4 creates several health-related funds in the Department of Treasury and designates that 90% of all tobacco settlement revenue received in 2003 and subsequent years be deposited in the various funds. The remaining 10% of tobacco settlement revenue is to be deposited in the state's general fund for other purposes as appropriated by the Legislature. The percentage of tobacco settlement revenue allocated to the three newly created funds and the distribution within each fund is summarized below:<BR>  <BR>  Tobacco Illness Care Fund:  46%<BR>  Nonprofit Hospitals:  28%<BR>  Licensed Hospices:  2%<BR>  School-linked Health Centers:  1%<BR>  Licensed Nursing Homes:  13%<BR>  Nurse Practitioners:  1%<BR>  Healthy Michigan Foundation:  1%<BR>  Tobacco Settlement Research and Education Fund:  31%<BR>  Tobacco-Free Futures Fund:  15%<BR>  Council of Michigan Foundations:  2%<BR>  Health and Aging Research/Development:  13%<BR>  Michigan Nurses Scholarship Program:  1%<BR>  Senior Citizen Prescription Drug Assistance Fund:  13%<BR>  Elder Prescription Drug Program:  13%<BR>  General Fund:  10%<BR>  <BR>  In addition to the specific allocations of tobacco settlement revenue in Proposal 02-4, there are several significant conditions and requirements related to these and other state funds included in the petition language.<BR>  <BR>  Unspent Funds<BR>  The proposal specifies that any tobacco settlement revenue (including investment earnings) that remains in any of the three newly-created funds at the close of the state's fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund. This means that the unspent monies could not be appropriated by the Legislature for any other purpose. In addition, any funds that cannot be provided to an eligible recipient organization because it ceases to exist or otherwise is unable to accept tobacco settlement revenue will be distributed proportionately to the other designated recipients.<BR>  <BR>  Annual Report<BR>  Each recipient of tobacco settlement revenue must file an annual report itemizing expenditures. The Auditor General is required to prepare an annual Tobacco Settlement Revenue Accountability report itemizing how the funds are appropriated and expended based on annual reports from all fund recipients.<BR>  <BR>  Hold Harmless Provision<BR>  Proposal 02-4 clarifies that the tobacco settlement allocations are considered separate, distinct, and in addition to the annual amounts appropriated for the Medicaid program. It further states that Medicaid program expenditures for hospitals and other health care services may not be reduced as a result of the allocation of tobacco settlement revenue in the proposed constitutional amendment.<BR>  <BR>  Proposal 02-4 would also require that the ratio of total state expenditures distributed to hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and nurse practitioners be equal to or greater than the ratio in FY 2000-01. The ratio is also to be adjusted to reflect changes in the federal Medicaid matching rate, and changes in the number and type of Medicaid enrollees. Other state health care program expenditures are also required to be continued at not less than the amount appropriated in FY 2000-01.<BR>  <BR>  ANALYSIS OF FISCAL IMPACT<BR>  <BR>  The annual amount of tobacco settlement revenue that each state receives varies from year to year based on a variety of factors. It is estimated that Michigan's FY 2002-03 allocation of tobacco settlement revenue will total $328.6 million.  If Proposal 02-4 is adopted, $215.7 million in additional revenue would be required to maintain the current appropriations for Merit Award scholarships, respite care for seniors, Medicaid services and a variety of other initiatives. Without additional or alternative revenues, reductions in funding to these programs would be required. In subsequent years, further funding reductions would be required because $39.0 million in unspent tobacco settlement revenue carried forward from the prior fiscal year and appropriated in FY 2002-03 would no longer be available.<BR>  <BR>  The hold harmless provisions that prohibit cuts in Medicaid and other health care program funding from FY 2000-01 levels and the maintenance of Medicaid spending for hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and nurse practitioners at the same percentage of total state spending in FY 2000-01 would adversely affect funding for other state priorities. In FY 2000-01 the total Medicaid expenditures for the provider groups identified in Proposal 02-4 exceed $1.8 billion. This represents over 5% of the entire state budget for that year, and spending for these items would have to be maintained at the same percentage of the total state expenditures in the future. Any increases in state revenues in subsequent years, regardless of the fund source or purpose, could also potentially result in automatic adjustments in Medicaid funding for the above-mentioned provider groups.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, Medicaid costs consume over 25% of state GF/GP revenues. The proposal provisions that maintain current funding levels and require increases to accommodate anticipated Medicaid caseload growth at a time when federal Medicaid revenues are expected to decline by $120.0 million per year will undoubtedly increase Medicaid state GF/GP funding. As a result of the proposal, anticipated demographic and caseload changes, and reductions in federal funds available to Michigan, Medicaid's share of the state GF/GP budget could grow to more than 30% within several years.<BR>  <BR>  Scheduled declines in state revenues due to reductions in the state's income tax and single business tax rates along with recent federal tax changes will prevent Michigan from meeting the mandates of Proposal 02-4 without substantial cuts in other parts of the state budget. Projected decreases in future tobacco settlement revenues tied to lowered volume of cigarette sales will further erode the funds available to finance the programs and projects supported with these dollars by 3 to 5% per year according to some estimates.<BR>  <BR>  It has also been argued that there may be offsetting savings to Michigan's budget from increased funding for smoking prevention programs. A recent report from the American Legacy Foundation asserts that implementation of comprehensive tobacco control programs that reduce smoking also lower state Medicaid spending attributable to smoking. At this time, it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of particular expenditures in the ballot proposal on overall Medicaid costs in Michigan.<BR>  <BR>  However, any potential savings would likely occur in the future and would not affect the FY 2002-03 budget. Because of requirements in the tobacco settlement revenue proposal that maintain Medicaid spending a 2001 levels, any savings from lowered smoking related-Medicaid costs would not be available for spending elsewhere.<BR>  [CA]",Proposal 02-4,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.336,,0
1210,Michigan,2002,"Bonds for Sewage Treatment Works, Storm Water and Water Pollution Projects","The proposal would:<BR>  <BR>  1. Authorize the State of Michigan to borrow a sum not to exceed $1 billion to improve the quality of the waters of the state by financing sewage treatment works projects, storm water projects and water pollution projects.<BR>  2. Authorize the state to issue general obligation bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds.<BR>  3. Provide for repayment of the bonds from the general fund of the state.<BR>  <BR>  House Fiscal Agency Analysis<BR>  <BR>  If voters approve Proposal 02-2 at the November 5 general election, General Obligation Bonds totaling $1 billion could be sold.  Public Acts 396, 397, and 398 of 2002 (enacted House Bills 4625, 5892, and 5893) would implement language allowing revenue derived from the sale of these bonds to be used to finance sewage treatment works projects, storm water projects, and nonpoint source pollution projects.<BR>  <BR>  Annual bond sales could not exceed $100 million.  Assuming that each $100 million issue would be sold with a 5% interest rate and would be repaid over a ten-year period, annual debt service payments from the state's general fund would initially be $12.7 million.  If subsequent sales were to occur every two years, debt service obligations would rise to $63.6 million in year ten of the program.<BR>  <BR>  Local governmental units would borrow funds for sewer infrastructure projects from the State Revolving Fund, and repay these loans over a 30-year period at a subsidized interest rate.",Proposal 02-2,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.602,,1
1211,Michigan,2002,Grant State Classified Employees the Constitutional Right to Collective Bargaining with Binding Arbitration,"The proposed constitutional amendment would:<BR>  <BR>  1. Grant state classified employees, in appropriate bargaining units determined by the Civil Service Commission, the right to elect bargaining representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining with the state employer.<BR>  2. Require the state to bargain in good faith for the purpose of reaching a binding collective bargaining agreement with any elected bargaining representatives over wages, hours, pensions and other terms and conditions of employment.<BR>  3. Extend the bargaining representatives the right to submit any unresolved disputes over the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to binding arbitration 30 days after the commencement of bargaining.<BR>  <BR>  House Fiscal Agency Analysis<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Proposal 02-3, also known as the Michigan Employee Rights Initiative (MERIT), contains language which would amend Article XI, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Michigan's first experience with binding arbitration ended with a $28 million award to be paid by the state in 1995.  That award covered three years of retroactive pay for state police troopers and sergeants.<BR>  <BR>  The state is in binding arbitration for a second time with the Michigan State Police Troopers Association (MSPTA).  This binding arbitration is expected to cost the state approximately $25 million (the cost of the last best offer ranges from $21 million to $35 million).<BR>  <BR>  If the state was in the same position with all classified state employees represented by unions, which is equivalent to over 40,000 or 20 times the number of troopers and sergeants, the retroactive costs for a three-year contract could exceed $500 million (20 x $25 million).  The costs could be even higher if all state employees were covered by binding arbitation.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, there are about 61,400 state employees.  Of those, approximately 1,900 are troopers or sergeants represented by a union; approximately 42,500 are other classified state employees represented by unions; and about 17,000 are non-exclusively represented employees (managerial, supervisory, or confidential) excluded from collective bargaining rights pursuant to Civil Service Commission rules, or employees in the Business and Administrative unit.<BR>  <BR>  Collective bargaining agreements are in place with all of the unions except the MSPTA.  These agreements commenced January 1, 2002, and are valid for a period of three years, through December 31, 2004.<BR>  <BR>  If the proposal is adopted and these contracts agreements remain valid, costs related to the ballot proposal for the over 40,000 state employees currently represented by unions would not begin to occur until January 2005 (FY 2005-06 budget).  At this time, a 1% increase for all classified state employees costs the state over $30 million.<BR>  <BR>  The Office of the State Employer interprets the ballot proposal language to mean that many state employees who currently are excluded from collective bargaining would be included.  The Civil Service Commission approves pay each year for this excluded group of employees.<BR>  <BR>  Approval of pay has been completed for FY 2002-03.  Therefore, costs could start to occur in FY 2003-04 if employees currently not represented by a union are deemed eligible to bargain and are placed by the Civil Service Commission in a unit or units that elect a union.<BR>  <BR>  Because the complete intent of the ballot proposal language is unclear on a number of different issues, and there are numerous questions remaining to be answered, it is difficult to ascertain a realistic range of the fiscal implications to the state if Proposal 02-3 is adopted.<BR>  <BR>  Immediate fiscal impact, if any, cannot be determined.  There are, however, likely to be long-term costs to the state if proposal 02-3 is adopted.  New contracts are likely to include higher wage and salary increases.  Each 1% increase in wages under current contracts would increase costs approximately $30 million per year.<BR>  <BR>  The immediate fiscal impact will depend primarily on two factors:<BR>  1.  Whether or not current contracts for approximately 42,500 classified state employees will be subject to renegotiation and binding arbitration results in retroactive wage increases; and<BR>  2.  Whether or not approximately 17,000 managerial, supervisory, or confidential employees not currently represented by a union can, and do, unionize and, through binding arbitration, receive salary increases.<BR>  <BR>  Whether either factor actually can or will occur cannot be determined because the validity of either may require legal action.  If both occur, there could be a significant fiscal impact that would depend on the results of binding arbitration.  If neither occurs, there would be no immediate fiscal impact.<BR>  [CA]",Proposal 02-3,Initiative,Labor & Employment,General,0.456,,0

Actual costs are indeterminate.<BR>  <BR>  If results for a U.S. presidential election show a vote differential of less than 25,000, 2001 PA 269 requires an expedited canvass.

The proposed amendment to the Constitution would authorize the Legislature to set forth by law the circumstances under which a property tax abatement or an exemption of part of the assessed value of a single-family residence may be granted to avoid a severe economic hardship to the owner of that residence. Such a property tax abatement or exemption could only be granted for single-family residences that are occupied by the owner of the residence. The Legislature would enact laws defining the kinds of economic hardships that would make a homeowner eligible for such an abatement or exemption, and setting forth the permissible amount and duration of the abatement or exemption.",Question 8,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.5820000000000001,,1
1439,Nevada,2002,Repeal the constitutional rule against perpetuities,"(Assembly Joint Resolution No. 4 of the 70th Session)<BR>  <BR>  CONDENSATION (ballot question)<BR>  Shall the Nevada Constitution be amended to repeal the constitutional rule against perpetuities? <BR>  <BR>  EXPLANATION<BR>  The Nevada Constitution currently prohibits transfers of property in perpetuity, except for charitable purposes. This means that persons who own real estate cannot transfer their interests to their heirs or to others if it is possible that such transfers would not actually take effect for a very extended or indefinite period of time. This situation typically arises when property is put in a legal trust for the benefit of future relatives or when property is being distributed under a person's will for future generations. To ensure that the indefinite state of ownership of the property will not go on perpetually, the rule against perpetuities voids a transfer of property if there is any possibility that the transfer will not vest within 21 years after the death of any persons living at the time the transfer was made. An interest in property is said to ""vest"" at the time the holder of the interest has the right to possess and use it. The proposed amendment would repeal the rule against perpetuities and allow the Legislature to address by law the issue of future property transfer.<BR>  <BR>  An obvious example of a violation of the rule against perpetuities would be a gift of property under a will or trust to a great, great, great grandchild, but the rule may also be violated in less obvious ways, such as when a will or trust provides that grandchildren will not receive an inheritance of property until they turn 25 years old.",Question 5,Legislative Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.401,,0
1440,Nevada,2002,Revise the term of office of a Supreme Court justice or district court judge who is appointed to fill a vacancy,"(Assembly Joint Resolution No. 13 of the 70th Session)<BR>  <BR>  CONDENSATION (ballot question)<BR>  Shall the Nevada Constitution be amended to revise the term of office of a Supreme Court justice or district court judge who is appointed to fill a vacancy? <BR>  <BR>  EXPLANATION<BR>  The Nevada Constitution specifies that the elective term of office of a Supreme Court justice or district court judge is 6 years. If an elected justice or judge is unable to complete his or her term of office, the vacancy is filled by appointment through a judicial selection process, as outlined in the Constitution. A justice or judge appointed to fill a vacancy must run in the next General Election (held in November in even-numbered years) to fill the balance of the original term of office. Depending on the particular circumstances, a person who is appointed to fill such a vacancy may serve in that capacity for as little as a few months to more than two years.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment to the Constitution would extend the time before a judicial vacancy must be filled by election. In most cases, this provision would allow an appointed justice or district judge to serve at least 12 months before that office is subject to a General Election. However, this extension of time before an election must be held would not apply if the date of appointment is made within the final 12 months of the original 6-year term of office. In such a case, the successor would be elected at the next General Election. The proposal also clarifies that an election to fill a vacated judicial office is only for the remainder of the unexpired term when any years remain in the original 6-year term of office.",Question 6,Legislative Referendum,Judiciary,General,0.405,,0

The proposed amendment would allow any persons who has attained the age of 21 years to use or possess three ounces or less of marijuana without being subject to arrest, civil or criminal penalty or seizure, or forfeiture of assets.   The constitutional amendment also requires the Legislature to provide or maintain penalties for driving dangerously or operating heavy machinery while under the influence of marijuana; for distributing or selling marijuana to persons under age 21 years; for persons under the age of 21 years using and possessing marijuana; for using marijuana in a vehicle or public place; and for distributing, selling, using or possessing marijuana on the premises of a jail, prison, or public school.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal also requires establishment of a system of regulation for the cultivation, taxation, sale and distribution of marijuana, including the distribution of marijuana at low cost to those medically authorized to use it. Under this system, all advertising of marijuana is prohibited. The purchase of marijuana from licensed establishments is authorized under this proposal. The transportation of marijuana in or out of state is prohibited unless federal law permits such transport. The license fees and taxes at wholesale are proposed to be the same as those for cigarettes and tobacco related products, respectively. The retail sales tax for marijuana is proposed to be the same as those of other products generally.<BR>  [CA]",Question 9,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.391,,0

The amendment would amend Title 3, Chapter 41A of the NRS by limiting noneconomic damages to $350,000, eliminating joint and several liability of a provider of health care based upon professional negligence, and revising the statute of limitations for the filing of actions. The amendment would add a new provision to Title 3, Chapter 42 of the NRS allowing a defendant to introduce into evidence all benefits payable to the plaintiff as a result of the injury or death, and make changes to how damages are paid, including future damages and periodic payments.

The amendment provides that a lawyer willfully involved in vexatious and frivolous litigation is personally liable for attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses in addition to any other sanction that may be imposed. ""Vexatious and frivolous"" means filing or defending a lawsuit solely to harass the opposing party or to seek economic gain unrelated to the merits of the lawsuit.

The proposed amendment would change this language to provide that no person ""who has been adjudicated mentally incompetent, unless restored to legal capacity,"" shall be entitled to vote in Nevada. A ""Yes"" vote is a vote to remove language from Section 1, Article 2 of the Nevada Constitution referring to an idiot or insane person and replace it with language referring to persons who have been adjudicated mentally incompetent and not restored to legal capacity.

1450,Nevada,2006,Board of Regents,"EXPLANATION<BR>  The Nevada Constitution authorizes the Board of Regents to control and manage the affairs and funds of the Nevada System of Higher Education, which consists of the state universities, state college, community colleges, research facilities, and public service departments.  The Constitution currently requires the Legislature to provide for the election of the Regents. In 2001, the Legislature set the number of Regents at 13 members, determined the geographic boundaries of the districts, and fixed the terms of office at six years.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment to the Constitution would set the number of Regents at nine. One member would be elected from each of Nevadas congressional districts and the Governor would appoint the remaining members. Not more than two-thirds of the appointed members of the Board may be of the same political party. The length of term of office would be four years.  Initially, the Legislature and the Governor would stagger the terms so that an equal number, as nearly as possible, would expire every two years. If a vacancy occurs during the term of an appointed member, the Governor would appoint a similarly qualified person to fill the remainder of the unexpired term. Nevada currently is apportioned three seats in the United States House of Representatives. If at any time Nevada is apportioned more than nine congressional seats, the Legislature would establish the districts from which the nine members would be elected.<BR>  <BR>  A ""Yes"" vote would amend the Nevada Constitution to set the membership of the Board of Regents at nine members, to fix the term of office at four years, and to provide for the election of one member from each congressional district with the appointment of the remaining members by the Governor according to staggered terms.<BR>  <BR>  A ""No"" vote would retain existing provisions regarding the election of members of the Board of Regents under the Nevada Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - NO<BR>  The proposal to amend the Nevada Constitution would revise the method by which members of the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education are selected.

Smoking tobacco would also be prohibited within school buildings and on school property.<BR>  <BR>  Smoking tobacco would continue to be allowed at the following locations: areas within casinos where loitering by minors is prohibited; stand-alone bars, taverns and saloons; strip clubs or brothels; retail tobacco stores; and private residences, including a private residence that serves as an office workplace. A stand-alone bar, tavern or saloon means an establishment devoted primarily to the sale of alcohol, in which food service is limited to the sale of prepackaged food items that are exempt from Nevada food-handling license requirements.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would also allow a county, city or town to adopt tobacco control measures stricter than those provided in the text of the Question itself.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would also require ""no smoking"" signs to be conspicuously posted at locations where smoking tobacco is prohibited.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - CANNOT BE DETERMINED<BR>  Question 5 proposes to amend Chapter 202 of the Nevada Revised Statutes to prohibit smoking in government buildings, schools, and other indoor places of employment, including, but not limited to, child care facilities, video arcades, indoor portions of restaurants, movie theaters, grocery stores, malls, and other retail establishments. The proposed prohibition on smoking would not apply to areas of casinos where loitering by minors is prohibited; stand-alone bars, taverns, and saloons; retail tobacco stores; strip clubs and brothels; and private residences, unless that private residence houses a child care, adult day care, or health care facility.<BR>  <BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE INITIATIVE<BR>  Establishments where smoking is prohibited by Question 5 would be required to conspicuously post ""No Smoking"" signs at all entrances and throughout the establishment. State law currently prohibits smoking in public buildings, except in specific designated areas, and requires the posting of ""No Smoking"" signage in areas not designated as smoking areas. It is difficult to determine the amount of new or additional signage needed in state and local buildings, beyond those required by current statute, to comply with the provisions of Question 5. Thus, the specific financial impact to state and local governments, including school districts, with regard to the implementation of the provisions of Question 5 requiring ""No Smoking"" signage at all entrances and throughout public buildings cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.<BR>  <BR>  State and local governments would also be required to remove all ashtrays and other smoking paraphernalia from public buildings where smoking is prohibited. State law currently prohibits smoking in public buildings, except in specific designated areas.

Therefore, the specific financial impact to state and local governments, including school districts, with regard to the implementation of the provisions of Question 5 requiring the removal of ashtrays and other smoking paraphernalia from public buildings cannot be reliably estimated.<BR>  <BR>  Current statute requires health authorities and law enforcement agencies to enforce smoking laws within the state, but it is difficult to identify any potential increase in duties or responsibilities requiring additional resources to enforce Question 5 compared to those required by current statute.

Additionally, the proposal would increase the allowance for expenses incurred for postage, express charges, newspapers, telecommunications, and stationery. Approval of the proposal is estimated to increase the total cost of a regular session by $554,400.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the Nevada Constitution provides for compensation of $130 per day for a maximum of 60 days during a regular session and a maximum of 20 days for a special session. Approval of this proposal would require up to 60 days of additional compensation for each legislator during a regular session, which would increase personnel expenses by $491,400. Inasmuch as recent special sessions have lasted for less than 20 days, approval of the proposal is not projected to increase personnel expenses associated with a special session.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the Nevada Constitution provides Legislators a maximum allowance of $60 per regular or special session for expenses incurred for postage, express charges, newspapers, and stationery. The proposal would allow for the inclusion of telecommunications within the allowed expenses and change the fixed sum of $60 to a ""reasonable allowance."" An actual dollar amount for the reasonable allowance would need to be established by law at a later date, but for the purposes of estimating the financial impact, it is assumed that $1,060 is a reasonable allowance based on available information.

Therefore, if this amendment passes in November 2006, it will appear on the ballot again for approval in November 2008 before it takes effect.]<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment, if passed, would create a new section within Article 1 of the Nevada Constitution. The amendment provides that the transfer of property taken in an eminent domain action from one private party to another private party would not be considered taken for a public use.<BR>  <BR>  The State or its political subdivisions or agencies would not be allowed to occupy property taken in an eminent domain action until the government provides a property owner with all government property appraisals. The government would have the burden to prove that any property taken was taken for a public use.<BR>  <BR>  If property is taken by the State or its political subdivisions or agencies for a public use, the property must be valued at its highest and best use. In an eminent domain action, just compensation would be considered a sum of money that puts a property owner in the same position as if the property had not been taken, and includes compounded interest and reasonable costs and expenses. Fair market value, for eminent domain purposes, would be defined as the ""highest price the property would bring on the open market.""<BR>  <BR>  If property taken in an eminent domain proceeding is not used for the purpose the property was taken for within five years, the original property owner would be able to reclaim the property upon repayment of the original purchase price.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - CANNOT BE DETERMINED<BR>  Question 2 proposes to amend Article 1 of Nevada's Constitution regarding the determination of public use of property, payment for private property taken under eminent domain actions, and the rights of property owners in eminent domain actions. The provisions of Question 2 cannot become effective until after the 2008 General Election.<BR>  <BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT OF QUESTION 2<BR>  Question 2 declares that public use does not include transfers of property taken in an eminent domain proceeding from one private party to another private party. Although the use of this type of transfer of private property for projects by government entities is eliminated, an estimate of the financial impact to state and local governments planning to use this type of transfer after the effective date of the Question 2 cannot be determined.<BR>  <BR>  The provision requiring taken or damaged property to be valued at its highest and best use potentially increases the costs incurred by state or local government entities to provide the required payments to property owners under eminent domain proceedings. Given the difficulty projecting the level and scope of eminent domain proceedings state and local governments may undertake after the effective date of the Question 2, the potential financial impact on state or local governments cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The potential increase in the costs may cause government entities to forego certain projects requiring the taking of private property under eminent domain actions.<BR>  <BR>  The provisions of the Question 2 may potentially increase the number of cases involving eminent domain actions. The potential increase in expenses incurred by state and district courts from handing a larger number of cases involving eminent domain actions cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.<BR>  The fiscal note was prepared by the Legislative Counsel Bureau pursuant to NRS 295.015<BR>  <BR>  DESCRIPTION OF EFFECT<BR>  The following constitutional provisions shall supersede all conflicting Nevada law regarding eminent domain actions.<BR>  - Transfer of land from one private party to another private party is not public use.<BR>   Before the government may occupy property, it must provide appraisals and prove the taking is for public use.<BR>  - Property must be valued at the use which yields the highest value.<BR>  - Just compensation is the sum of money including interest compounded annually necessary to put the owner in the same position without offsets as if the property was not taken.<BR>  - Property taken but not used within five years for the purpose for which it was taken must be returned to the owner.<BR>  - Fair market value is the highest price the property would bring on the open market.<BR>  - Property owners shall not be liable for the government's attorney fees or costs.<BR>  <BR>  (The following portions of the Description of Effect have been stricken to be consistent with the Nevada Supreme Court Order in Nevadans for the Protection of Property Rights, Inc. et al v.

1456,Nevada,2006,Raise the Minimum Wage for Working Nevadans Act (2nd consideration),"[NOTE: This measure was passed in the November 2004 election.  In Nevada, constitutional amendments must be passed in two consecutive general elections before they may take effect. Therefore, Question 6 also appears on the November 2006 ballot for voter approval.]<BR>  <BR>  EXPLANATION<BR>  The proposed amendment, if passed, would create a new section to Article 15 of the Nevada Constitution. The amendment would require employers to pay Nevada employees $5.15 per hour worked if the employer provides health benefits, or $6.15 per hour worked if the employer does not provide health benefits. The rates shall be adjusted by the amount of increases in the federal minimum wage over $5.15 per hour, or, if greater, by the cumulative increase in the cost of living measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with no CPI adjustment for any one-year period greater than 3%.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - CANNOT BE DETERMINED<BR>  Although the proposal to amend the Nevada Constitution to increase the minimum wage in Nevada could result in additional costs to Nevada's businesses, the impact on a particular business would depend on the number of employees working at a wage below the new requirement, the amount by which the wages would need to be increased and any actions taken by the business to offset any increased costs associated with the increased wage requirement.<BR>  <BR>  The proposal would, however, result in beneficial financial impacts for employees who receive a wage increase as a result of the proposal and who are not impacted adversely by any actions taken by the business to offset the increased costs associated with the increased wage requirement.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, if the proposal results in an increase in annual wages paid by Nevada's employers, revenues received by the State from the imposition of the Modified Business Tax would also increase.<BR>  [CA]",Ballot Question 6,Initiative,Labor & Employment,General,0.687,,1
1457,Nevada,2006,Regulation of Marijuana,"EXPLANATION<BR>  The proposed amendments, if passed, would make various changes to Nevada law with respect to the possession and use of certain amounts of marijuana. The amendments would allow persons at least 21 years of age to purchase, possess, use and transport up to one ounce of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  The amendments would also require that marijuana retailers and wholesalers be licensed by the Nevada Department of Taxation. The amendments would subject the wholesale sale of marijuana to an excise tax, and would subject the retail sale of marijuana to the existing sales tax.  The financial impact of license fees and excise taxes is further described in the Fiscal Note.  After a deduction to defray the cost of tax collection, fifty percent of the tax revenue from the sale of marijuana would be used to fund voluntary programs for the prevention and treatment of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances, and the other fifty percent would go to the state general fund.<BR>  <BR>  Under the amendments, the following activities would continue to be unlawful: operation of vehicles and vessels under the influence of marijuana; possession a firearm while under the influence of marijuana; possession of marijuana by a prisoner; and possession of marijuana in a public place, correctional facility, or school.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendments would increase the maximum prison terms and fines for violations of NRS 484.3795 (death or substantial bodily harm from driving under the influence) from 20 to 40 years imprisonment and from $5,000 to $10,000 in fines. The proposed amendments would also make it a class B felony for a person over 21 to sell or give marijuana to a minor.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendments would have no affect on federal laws that prohibit the sale, possession, use and transport of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - CANNOT BE DETERMINED<BR>  Question 7 proposes to amend the Nevada Revised Statutes to legalize and regulate the sale, possession, and use of one ounce or less of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia within the state of Nevada, by persons at least 21 years of age, under certain circumstances. Question 7 increases the criminal penalties for causing death or substantial bodily harm while driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Question 7 also provides for licensure of wholesalers and retailers of marijuana, requires the collection of state and local sales taxes on marijuana sold by retailers, and requires the Nevada Department of Taxation to collect an excise tax on marijuana sold by wholesalers.<BR>  <BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT OF QUESTION 7<BR>  State and local courts and law enforcement agencies may need additional resources or the reallocation of current resources to administer and enforce the provisions of Question 7. It is not possible to estimate the resources that may be required by state and local governments due to the legalization of marijuana under Question 7. The specific financial impact on the state or any of the various local government entities from changes in law enforcement activities and court proceedings cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.<BR>  <BR>  Question 7 increases the maximum penalty for causing death or substantial bodily harm while driving under the influence from 20 years in state prison and a $5,000 fine to 40 years in state prison and a $10,000 fine. Increasing the maximum sentence that can be imposed may increase the cumulative costs associated with incarceration in state correctional facilities. Since it is difficult to predict the number of cases requiring the imposition of a sentence and the length of sentence set by judges, a specific financial impact on the state budget cannot be established.<BR>  <BR>  Question 7 requires the Department of Taxation to develop and implement regulations regarding the licensing of wholesalers and retailers, and collect an annual $1,000 license fee from these entities. The Department would also be required to collect an excise tax of $45 on each ounce of marijuana sold by wholesalers licensed under Question 7. The Department would incur costs related to the development and administration of regulations regarding licensing and collection of the excise tax and license fees. This should not have a financial impact upon the state budget, as the provisions of Question 7 allow the Department to retain a portion of the proceeds sufficient to cover the administrative costs incurred by the Department as a result of these requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Revenues generated from the excise tax and license fees, less the administrative costs retained by the Department of Taxation, must be deposited in the State General Fund. Question 7 requires that 50 percent of these funds be distributed to the Health Division of the Department of Human Resources for voluntary drug, alcohol, and tobacco treatment and prevention programs. Additionally, retailers would be required to collect state and local sales taxes on any marijuana sold, resulting in additional sales tax revenue for the State General Fund, local governments and school districts. The level of production and consumption of marijuana that would occur cannot be easily established. Although the taxes collected from the wholesale and retail sales of marijuana could generate additional revenue for state and local governments, including school districts, a specific dollar amount cannot be reasonably estimated.<BR>  <BR>  The fiscal note was prepared by the Legislative Counsel Bureau pursuant to NRS 295.015.<BR>  [S]",Ballot Question 7,Initiative,Criminal Justice,General,0.441,,0
1458,Nevada,2006,Responsibly Protect Nevadans from Second-Hand Smoke Act,"EXPLANATION<BR>  The proposed amendment, if passed, would prohibit smoking tobacco at the following locations:  certain indoor restaurants; certain child care facilities; elementary, secondary and high school property; hospitals and medical offices; theaters and concert halls; video arcades; government buildings; all areas within grocery stores, drug stores and convenience stores except the gaming areas; and museums, galleries, and other places of public display.<BR>  <BR>  Smoking tobacco would continue to be allowed at the following locations: casinos or facilities with an unrestricted gaming license; bars, taverns, saloons; restaurants where persons under the age of 21 are not allowed; strip clubs and brothels; retail tobacco stores; private residences, including, hotel and motel rooms, and private residences that are used as office workplaces; and gaming areas within grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores and any other businesses that hold a Nevada gaming license.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would also provide that only the Nevada Legislature may regulate the smoking of tobacco.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would also require ""no smoking"" signs to be conspicuously posted at locations where smoking tobacco is prohibited.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - CANNOT BE DETERMINED<BR>  Question 4 proposes to amend Chapter 202 of Nevada Revised Statutes to prohibit smoking in government buildings, schools, child care facilities, hospitals and medical offices, video arcades, indoor portions of restaurants, movie theaters, grocery stores and bakeries, retail establishments, drug and convenience stores, and museums, libraries, galleries, or other places of public display or collection. The proposed prohibition on smoking would not apply to facilities with nonrestricted gaming licenses; bars, taverns, and saloons; retail tobacco stores; strip clubs and brothels; hotel and motel rooms; and private residences, unless that private residence houses a child care facility. The proposed prohibition would also not apply to areas of businesses, such as grocery stores, drug and convenience stores, and other retail establishments, that are leased to or operated by persons licensed to provide gaming.<BR>  <BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE INITIATIVE<BR>  Establishments where smoking is prohibited by Question 4 would be required to conspicuously post ""No Smoking"" signs at all entrances and throughout the establishment. State law currently prohibits smoking in public buildings, except in specific designated areas, and requires the posting of ""No Smoking"" signage in areas not designated as smoking areas. It is difficult to determine the amount of new or additional signage needed in state and local buildings, beyond those required by current statute, to comply with the provisions of Question 4. Thus, the specific financial impact to state and local governments, including school districts, with regard to the implementation of the provisions of Question 4 requiring ""No Smoking"" signage at all entrances and throughout public buildings cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.<BR>  <BR>  The provisions of Question 4 give exclusive power over all regulations regarding the smoking of tobacco to the Nevada Legislature. Under current law, local governments are permitted to create ordinances regarding the smoking of tobacco, and to collect fines for violations of these ordinances. This provision of Question 4 would eliminate the authority of local governments to create ordinances and collect fines related to smoking. Any fines collected for the violation of regulations established by the Nevada Legislature in accordance with the provisions of Question 4 would be deposited in the State Permanent School Fund, as required under Article 11, Section 3 of the Nevada Constitution. With regard to the change of regulatory power over smoking from local governments to the Nevada Legislature, Question 4 would have a negative financial impact upon local governments and a positive financial impact upon the State Permanent School Fund.  However, as it is difficult to determine the number of offenses or amount of fines that will occur as a result of the provisions of Question 4, the specific financial impact to local governments or the State Permanent School Fund cannot be reliably estimated.<BR>  <BR>  Current statute requires health authorities and law enforcement agencies to enforce smoking laws within the state, but it is difficult to identify any potential increase in duties or responsibilities requiring additional resources to enforce Question 4 compared to those required by current statute. Since the need or demand for additional resources cannot be easily predicted, a reasonable estimate of the financial impact upon state and local governments with regard to enforcement of Question 4 cannot be made.<BR>  <BR>  The fiscal note was prepared by the Legislative Counsel Bureau pursuant to NRS 295.015.<BR>  [S]",Ballot Question 4,Initiative,Drug/Alcohol/Tobacco Policy,General,0.48,Amendment,0
1459,Nevada,2006,Sales and Use Tax of 1955,"EXPLANATION<BR>  The proposed amendment to the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 would exempt from both the state and local portions of the tax: (1) the value of any used vehicle taken in trade on the purchase of another vehicle and (2) the value of farm machinery and equipment. The proposals set forth in the question may not be voted upon individually.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the exemption for the value of any used vehicle taken in trade on the purchase of another vehicle listed in the above explanation applies only to the portion of the Sales and Use Tax distributed at the local level (currently between 4.5 and 5.75 percent), but does not apply to the portion distributed at the state level (2 percent).<BR>  <BR>  There is no current exemption for farm machinery and equipment from the local portion or the state portion of the Sales and Use Tax. If this proposal to provide the exemption from the state portion is approved, the Legislature has amended the Local School Support Tax Law and the City-County Relief Tax Law so that this exemption will also apply to the sales and use tax distributed at the local level.<BR>  <BR>  A ""Yes"" vote approves both proposals set forth in the question. The exemptions will apply to both the local portion and the state portion of the Sales and Use Tax.<BR>  <BR>  A ""No"" vote disapproves both proposals set forth in the question. The exemptions will not apply to either the local portion or the state portion of the Sales and Use Tax.<BR>  <BR>  FISCAL NOTE<BR>  FINANCIAL IMPACT - YES<BR>  IMPACT ON REVENUE COLLECTED BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS<BR>  Regardless of the outcome of this proposal, government revenues will be impacted in some manner. According to data provided by the Department of Taxation from Fiscal Year 2005, if the proposal is approved, state government revenues will likely be reduced in a single fiscal year by approximately $19.6 million and revenues distributed to local governments, including school districts, will likely be reduced by $1.6 million. Conversely, if the proposal is not approved, revenues distributed to local governments, including school districts, will likely be increased by approximately $51.0 million in a single fiscal year.<BR>  <BR>  In addition, the Department of Motor Vehicles retains a commission of 2 percent on the Sales and Use Tax collected by the Department when a vehicle is registered in Nevada and the required state and local Sales and Use Tax has not been paid prior to registration. According to data provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles from Fiscal Year 2005, if the proposal is approved, the amount of 2 percent commissions on Sales and Use Tax paid directly to the Department from out-of-state dealer sales with a vehicle trade-in allowance will likely be reduced by approximately $22,000 for a single fiscal year. If the measure is not approved, the amount of 2 percent commissions retained by the Department of Motor Vehicles will increase by approximately $41,000 for a single fiscal year.<BR>  <BR>  IMPACT ON AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER<BR>  The impact of the question on the average voter would depend on the extent to which the voter participates in transactions affected by the proposal. An explanation of the manner in which each proposal could impact voters is set forth below:<BR>  <BR>  USED VEHICLE TAKEN IN TRADE ON THE PURCHASE OF ANOTHER VEHICLE<BR>  Currently, a person who applies the trade-in value of his vehicle to the purchase of a new or used vehicle is required to pay the portion of the Sales and Use Tax distributed at the state level (2 percent) on the entire sales price of the new or used car without a deduction for the trade-in allowance. However, this person is authorized to deduct from the sales price the trade-in allowance for the purposes of the portion of the Sales and Use Tax distributed at the local level (currently between 4.5 to 5.75 percent depending on the county).<BR>  <BR>  If the question is approved, the purchaser of a new or used car will be able to deduct the trade-in allowance from the sales price of the new or used car for the purposes of both the portion of the Sales and Use Tax distributed at the state level and the portion distributed at the local level. In effect, the amount of tax paid will be reduced by 2 percent of the trade-in value of the used vehicle if the question is approved.<BR>  <BR>  If the question is not approved, the purchaser of a new or used car will be required to pay the portion of the Sales and Use Tax distributed at the state level and the portion distributed at the local level on the entire sales price of the new or used car without any deduction for the trade-in allowance. In effect, the amount of tax paid will increase by 4.5 to 5.75 percent of the trade-in value of the used vehicle if the question is not approved.<BR>  <BR>  FARM MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT<BR>  Currently, the gross receipts from the sale or the use of farm machinery and equipment are subject to both the state portion (2 percent) and the local portion (4.5 to 5.75 percent) of the Sales and Use Tax.<BR>  <BR>  If the question is approved, the gross receipts from the sale or the use of farm machinery and equipment would be exempt from both the state portion and the local portion of the Sales and Use Tax. In effect, the tax would be eliminated and the amount of tax paid for farm machinery and equipment will be reduced by 6.5 to 7.75 percent.<BR>  [S]",Ballot Question 8,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.688,,1
1460,Nevada,2008,Amends the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 to Authorizing the Legislature to Comply with Federal Law or Interstate Agreements,"This proposed amendment to the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 (Act) would authorize the Nevada Legislature to enact legislation amending or repealing any provision of this Act without obtaining additional voter approval whenever that legislation is necessary to carry out any federal law or interstate agreement for the administration, collection, or enforcement of sales and use taxes. The proposed amendment would not authorize the Legislature to enact any legislation that increases the rate of the tax imposed pursuant to this Act, currently 2 percent, without obtaining voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  Additionally, this amendment would repeal an exemption from the taxes imposed by the Act for the sale of aircraft and major components of aircraft to a scheduled air carrier based in Nevada. The language in the Act providing this exemption from the state's portion of the sales and use tax was declared unconstitutional by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1997. Thus, although the language remains in the Act, the exemption is no longer provided to air carriers. The Legislature cannot enact legislation to remove this unconstitutional language from the Act without voter approval. Existing law provides for the administration of sales and use taxes in Nevada pursuant to the Simplified Sales and Use Tax Administration Act, the Sales and Use Tax Act, and the Local School Support Tax Law. The state's portion of the sales and use tax is administered under provisions of the Act that were submitted to and approved by the voters at the 1956 General Election. These provisions cannot be amended or repealed without additional voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  Nevada has entered into the interstate ―Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement‖ to simplify and modernize sales and use tax administration in order to reduce the burden of tax compliance for all sellers and types of commerce. To maintain compliance with the provisions the Agreement, the Legislature may be required to enact legislation amending the Sales and Use Tax   Act and the Local School Support Tax Law in response to federal legislation approved by Congress affecting the Agreement or to interstate actions amending the Agreement.

The government would have the burden to prove that any property taken was taken for a public use.<BR>  <BR>  If property is taken by the State or its political subdivisions or agencies for a public use, the property must be valued at its highest and best use. In an eminent domain action, just compensation would be considered a sum of money that puts a property owner in the same position as if the property had not been taken, and includes compounded interest and reasonable costs and expenses. Fair market value, for eminent domain purposes, would be defined as the ""highest price the property would bring on the open market.""<BR>  <BR>  If property taken in an eminent domain proceeding is not used for the purpose the property was taken for within five years, the original property owner would be able to reclaim the property upon repayment of the original purchase price.<BR>  [CA]",Question 2,Initiative,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.608,,1

1516,New Jersey,2008,Voters to Approve State Authority Bonds Payable from State Appropriations,"This amendment to the State Constitution will require voter approval of new laws that allow the State to borrow money by issuing bonds through any State agency or independent authority backed by a pledge of an annual appropriation to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. New laws to allow the issuance of these State authority bonds for State government purposes will be subject to voter approval. State courts have ruled that the State constitutional requirement that the Legislature and Governor must seek voter approval for bonded debt does not apply to such borrowing. That requirement is followed only for proposed State bonds that contain a binding, non-repealable pledge to pay off the bonds directly with State taxes. Most State authority bonds can be issued without voter approval because the payment of the bonds is backed only by a promise of the Legislature and the Governor that they will enact appropriations in the future to meet the bond payments. The courts have said this is a legal means of avoiding submitting the issuance of debt for voter approval. Laws to permit such debt that are enacted after this amendment becomes part of the Constitution will have to authorize voter referenda for approval of such debts.  Exceptions to voter approval for authority bonds will be permitted if the bonds are to be paid off from 1) a source of revenue dedicated by the State Constitution, which only the voters can establish, or 2) an independent non-State government source of payments for use of projects built or obtained with the borrowed money, such as highway tolls or user fees.",Public Question,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.579,,1

That law increased the contributions taken from current and future justices' and judges' salaries for their benefits, starting in October 2011. The lawsuit, which was appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court, argued against taking the higher contributions from currently appointed justices and judges, citing language in the Constitution that their salaries cannot be reduced during their appointed terms.<BR>  <BR>  The amendment clarifies that such contributions, set by law, may be taken from justices' and judges' salaries during their terms.

Provide that the ""measure of competition"" of a legislative district be based on a calculation using the two average partisan indexes for the district, which are calculated on the basis of the percentage of votes received by each of the two partisan candidates who received the two highest vote totals statewide in each of the three closest general elections during the four previous even-numbered years prior to adopting a redistricting plan, keeping the index for one of the partisan affiliations always as the minuend and the index for the other partisan affiliation always as the subtrahend from district to district throughout a redistricting plan.<BR>  <BR>  5) Provide that the commission may consider whether to alter a plan to preserve communities of interest based on geography, economics, or race, so long as the reconfiguration does not result in a competitiveness number that is more than two points lower for a congressional plan and four points lower for a general assembly plan.<BR>  <BR>  6) Provide that the commission may design and adopt a redistricting plan if the plan meets the same criteria and has a competitive number equal to or greater than each submitted qualifying plan.<BR>  <BR>  7) Provide a method for the commission to assign state districts for senators whose term do not expire at the end of the first even-numbered year following adoption of the plan.<BR>  <BR>  8) Provide that legislative district boundaries shall change in 2007 and, thereafter, every year ending in one following a federal decennial census.<BR>  <BR>  9) Provide that the supreme court of Ohio has exclusive original jurisdiction involving redistricting plans adopted under the amendment, but limits such jurisdiction to ordering the commission to perform duties required under the amendment and prohibit the court from revising or adopting a plan.<BR>  <BR>  10) Provide for open meetings, public hearings, and certain public record requirements regarding the activities of the commission.<BR>  <BR>  11) Provide that the general assembly must appropriate sufficient funds for the commission to perform its duties.

1734,Ohio,2008,To Provide for Earlier Filing Deadlines for Statewide Ballot Issues,"<B>Purpose:</B><BR>  The Ohio Constitution and corresponding state laws describe the processes that electors themselves can undertake to propose amendments to the constitution, to establish state laws, and to submit to the voters for their approval or rejection laws recently enacted by the Ohio General Assembly. People who seek to initiate these processes must abide by constitutional and statutory deadlines. The purpose of Amended House Joint Resolution Number 3 (HJR 3) is to change the filing deadlines for statewide ballot initiatives and referendums (sometimes called ""statewide issues"").<BR>  <BR>  <B>HJR 3 Would Change Statewide Issue Petition Filing Deadlines:</B><BR>  Most statewide issues are submitted to the electors to vote upon at a regular or general election. In order for an issue to be placed on the ballot, it must be filed with the secretary of state's office as a petition signed by a substantial amount of supporters. Currently, petitions for proposed constitutional amendments and state laws must be filed at least 90 days before the election at which the issue is to be submitted to the electors. Referendum petitions must be filed at least 60 days before the election at which the issue is to be submitted.<BR>  <BR>  HJR 3 would require that petitions for all statewide issues brought by electors be filed 125 days before the election at which the issue is to be submitted to the electors. This means that people who seek to file a petition proposing a constitutional amendment or a state law or a referendum petition must do so earlier than they currently are required.  Passing HJR 3 also would mean that people who seek a referendum on any law that passes between 215 and 125 days before an upcoming regular or general election will have 90 days or less to undertake the entire referendum process if they want to ensure the placement of the issue on the ballot for the upcoming election. Any referendum petition filed after the 125-day deadline must be placed on the ballot at the regular or general election that occurs over a year later.<BR>  <BR>  <B>HJR 3 Would Change Deadlines for Verifying and Challenging the Petition:</B><BR>  Statewide issue petitions must be signed by many electors. The secretary of state's office and the county boards of elections check those signatures to make sure they are valid and sufficient. HJR 3 would require the secretary of state to determine if there are enough valid signatures on the petition to qualify it for placement on the ballot by the 105th day before the election.<BR>  <BR>  Sometimes, however, people challenge the statewide petition and signatures on the petition. HJR 3 gives the Supreme Court of Ohio the sole authority to hear these challenges. HJR 3 also requires all challenges to be filed not later than 95 days before the election and that the Court must rule on any challenges not later than 85 days before the election. In addition, under the new amendment, if no ruling is made stating that the petition or signatures are insufficient by the 85-day deadline, the signatures are presumed to be sufficient in all respects. If there is a ruling that the petition or signatures are insufficient and additional signatures are provided, HJR 3 would require the secretary of state to determine whether those additional signatures are sufficient not later than 65 days before the election.<BR>  <BR>  Challenges can be made on those additional signatures, but such challenge must be filed not later than 55 days before the day of the election. The Court must make a ruling on the additional signatures not later than 45 days before the election. Otherwise, the petition and the signatures will be presumed to be sufficient in all respects.<BR>  <BR>  If approved, this proposed amendment will be effective immediately.",Issue 1,Legislative Referendum,Elections-Initiative Process,General,0.687,,1

In addition, the Constitution currently requires loan applications to have been filed not later than January 31, 1985, or within the 30-year period immediately following the date on which the person was released from active duty.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 83 would eliminate the requirement that a portion of active duty occur prior to 1977.  Ballot Measure 83 provides that time spent training while on active duty does not count toward the 210 day minimum length of active duty service.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 83 retains the requirement that active duty must be for a period of at least 210 days or if discharge from active duty is due to a service-connected injury or illness.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 83 also establishes an alternative basis for meeting the active duty requirement that does not depend on the length of active duty.  Under the alternative, an Oregon resident would be eligible for a veterans' loan if the person's active duty was in a theater of operations for which a campaign or expeditionary ribbon or medal is authorized by the United States.  Ballot Measure 83 would also eliminate the requirement that a loan application be filed not later than January 31, 1985, but retains the requirement that application must be made within 30 years after the date of release from active duty.<BR>  <BR>  Home and farm loans to veterans are made from the Oregon War Veterans' Fund.  The Oregon War Veterans’ Fund is funded by the sale of bonds.  Under federal law, the interest income that bondholders receive from these bonds is exempt from federal income taxation.  Federal law, however, further provides that the interest on bonds that finance loans to veterans with active duty occurring only after 1976 is not exempt and therefore subject to federal income taxation.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 83 authorizes the Director of Veterans' Affairs to establish standards and priorities that the director determines best accomplish the purposes and promote the financial stability of the Oregon War Veterans' Fund, including those necessary to maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on bonds that fund Oregon veterans' home and farm loans.",Measure 83,Legislative Referendum,Banking & Financial Services,General,0.748,,1

Administrative rules are state agency directives, standards, regulations, or statements that implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy, or describe state agency procedures.  Administrative rules do not include executive orders or internal management directives.<BR>  <BR>  A petition under the measure must be filed with the Secretary of State.

Adjustment limited to that portion of the local option levy that was approved in that district as a serial or one-year levy to replace an existing serial or one-year levy. Requires that district's temporary property tax levy authority be reduced by same amount as adjustment made to district's permanent property tax authority.<BR>  <BR>  ESTIMATE OF FINANCIAL IMPACT: This measure affects both the permanent and local option tax rate limits only of Deschutes County, Linn County and the city of Sweet Home. In the first year, 2000-01, this measure will reduce the total authority for these three government units to impose operating taxes by a total of approximately $824,581. This measure shifts a part of the temporary local option authority of these three units to permanent rate authority.

Deschutes County's total tax authority is estimated to be reduced by $289,415 in 2000-01. Their local option authority expires beginning the following year, 2001-02. Linn County's tax authority is estimated to be reduced by $397,118 in 2000-01 and $72,928 in 2001-02. Their tax authority would increase an estimated $267,472 in 2002-03, depending upon the growth in property values in the county. The city of Sweet Home's tax authority will be reduced by an estimated $138,076 in 2000-01, $100,300 in 2001-02, and $60,635 in 2002-03. Both Linn County's and the city of Sweet Home's local option authority expires beginning the following year, 2003-04.<BR>  <BR>  In subsequent years, revenue estimates depend on whether local voters renew expiring levies. The level of local option tax authority that voters approve will also affect the total tax revenue effects from this measure. This measure does not affect a taxing dis-trict's ability to seek additional local option tax authority from local voters. The dollar amount raised from the new permanent tax rate authority established under this measure cannot be increased beyond the growth in assessed value.

Instead, this measure requires public schools and school districts to base a teacher's pay, including pay increases, on that teacher's job performance.<BR>  <BR>  The measure defines job performance as the degree to which the appropriate knowledge of the teacher's students increased while under the teacher's instruction.  The measure does not address how or by whom appropriate knowledge will be defined or measured.<BR>  <BR>  The measure also changes the basis for determining which teachers are retained when layoffs occur.  Under current law, public schools and school districts may use the length of time teaching as one factor in determining which teachers are retained when a layoff occurs.  The measure requires that the increase in students' appropriate knowledge while under a teacher's instruction be the sole determining factor when making layoff decisions, unless doing so would result in the public school or school district retaining a teacher less qualified to teach the subject needed.<BR>  <BR>  The measure allows cost of living pay increases to public school teachers, limited to the consumer price index.

For example, if this measure passes by sixty percent, it will require sixty percent approval of future taxes, fees and charges. It also requires a refund of certain past collections.<BR>  <BR>  Oregon law generally requires voter approval for property taxes, and allows voters to refer other taxes.  Fees and charges generally are not subject to voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  Voter approval of new and increased taxes, fees and charges can be given only at the biennial general election or at an annual election if the legislature permits approval of statewide initiatives at that election.

The Measure is retroactive and would allow rates giving utilities profits on the Trojan nuclear plant, which shut down permanently in 1992.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 90 would have these effects:<BR>  1.  It would reinstate a 1995 order of the Oregon Public Utility Commission (Commission) giving Portland General Electric Co. (PGE) profits on the closed Trojan nuclear plant by allowing PGE to charge ratepayers approximately $304 million for “return on investment” or profit on Trojan.<BR>  2.  It would nullify the decision of the Oregon Court of Appeals that present law (enacted by voters by initiative in 1978) prohibits utilities from charging rates giving them profits for retired plants, including Trojan.<BR>  3.  It would allow utilities to charge rates high enough to receive, at the same time, profits on retired plants and also profits on the plants the utilities build to replace them.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 90 would apply to all public utilities regulated by the Oregon Commission.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 90 seeks to bypass, as to retired plants, the existing statute, enacted by Oregon voters in 1978, which states:   ""No public utility shall, directly or indirectly, by any device, charge, demand, collect or receive from any customer rates which are derived from a rate base which includes within it any construction, building, installation or real or personal property not presently used for providing utility service to the customer.""<BR>  <BR>  Measure 90, however, would authorize the Oregon Commission to allow utilities to receive profits on plants, including those which have stopped working or are otherwise retired before the end of their expected lives.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 90 is retroactive and would apply to all utility plants and property retired in the past.  The Trojan nuclear plant was permanently closed in 1992, 19 years before the end of its expected life.  In 1995, the Oregon Commission allowed PGE to charge ratepayers approximately $304 million to give PGE stockholders a ""return on investment"" or profit on Trojan.  (This assumes no future change to the rate of return the Oregon Commission approved for PGE.)  By the end of 1999, PGE ratepayers had paid approximately $150 million to PGE for Trojan profits.<BR>  <BR>  In 1998, the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the 1995 Oregon Commission order, concluding that present law (the 1978 ballot measure) prohibits utilities from charging rates to receive profits on plants not providing service, including Trojan.

The measure requires that the Department of State Police, in addition to conducting a criminal background check, determine whether a person is prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm.  Such prohibited persons include persons convicted of felonies and certain violent misdemeanors, and mentally ill persons who under state law are prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm.<BR>  <BR>  The measure grants immunity from civil liability to a person who requests a background check and receives approval before transferring a firearm, unless the person knows or should know that the person to whom the firearm is being transferred is likely to commit an unlawful act involving the firearm.

For most public offices, vacancies are filled by appointment.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 31 allows the Legislative Assembly to pass laws that change this result. The laws would apply only in cases when a candidate nominated for elective public office dies before the election and would provide that: (1) The regularly scheduled election for that office be postponed; (2) The office be filled at a subsequent special election; and (3) Votes cast for candidates for the office at the regularly scheduled election may not be considered, and the surviving candidates must stand for and campaign for a subsequent special election.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 31 is needed to provide exceptions to other provisions of the Oregon Constitution that state that the person who receives the highest number of votes is elected and that require certain offices to be filled at the general election.<BR>  <BR>  At its 2003 regular session, the Legislative Assembly passed a law that will take effect only if Ballot Measure 31 is approved by the people. The law applies only to candidates nominated by a major political party for the office of Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, Attorney General, state Senator or state Representative. If a candidate nominated by a major political party for one of those offices dies within 30 days of a November general election, the election for that office only will be postponed. The Secretary of State will call a subsequent special election and the ballots cast for that office at the November general election may not be counted.",Measure 31,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.6559999999999999,Amendment,1
1877,Oregon,2004,Amends Constitution:  Deletes Reference to Mobile Homes from Provision Dealing with Taxes and Fees on Motor Vehicles,"Ballot Measure 32 (Senate Joint Resolution 14) proposes an amendment to section 3a, Article IX of the Oregon Constitution. Section 3a, Article IX, specifies how revenues from taxes and fees on motor vehicles may be used. Under the current version of the section, fees on mobile homes are treated the same way as fees on campers, motor homes, travel trailers, snowmobiles and like vehicles. Revenues from the fees may be used only for highways and parks or recreation areas and for administrative expenses for highways and parks or recreation areas.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 32 was referred to voters by the 2003 Legislature. It proposes to delete the term ""mobile homes"" from section 3a, Article IX of the Constitution. The Legislature has approved legislation directing that these fees be used for building code related services, as well as recording and transferring ownership documents for these homes, and assisting counties in gathering tax related information on mobile homes.  The effect of Ballot Measure 32 would be to allow fees imposed on mobile homes to be used for these purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The 2003 Legislature transferred authority to regulate mobile homes from the Driver and Motor Vehicles Services Division (DMV) to the Oregon Building Codes Division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS). Mobile homes will no longer be titled as vehicles in Oregon.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 32 has no effect on owners of mobile homes continuing to pay highway use taxes and fees when moving the homes on the highways.",Measure 32,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.613,Amendment,1
1878,Oregon,2004,Amends Constitution:  Limits Noneconomic Damages (Defined) Recoverable for Patient Injuries Caused by Healthcare Provider's Negligence or Recklessness,"The Oregon Constitution currently acts to prohibit limitations on awards of noneconomic damages in many types of civil actions.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 35 would amend the Oregon Constitution to impose a limit on noneconomic damages that may be claimed in certain actions. The measure applies to claims made by injured patients and legal representatives of injured patients, including persons claiming loss of consortium (the loss of the company, affection, assistance and sexual relations of a spouse). The limitation applies only to claims made by such persons against healthcare providers and healthcare entities licensed in Oregon, for injuries incurred while the provider or entity was acting within the scope of the license. The limitation applies to claims based on negligence or recklessness, but does not apply to claims based on intentional injury. Nor does it limit claims for wrongful death.<BR>  <BR>  If a claim is subject to Ballot Measure 35, the measure would impose a limitation of $500,000 (adjusted annually for inflation) on the amount that can be claimed as noneconomic damages arising from injury to any one patient that may be recoverable from health care providers or entities. Noneconomic damages are defined as all subjective nonmonetary losses suffered by an injured patient, including but not limited to pain, mental suffering, emotional distress, loss of care, comfort, companionship and society, loss of consortium, inconvenience and interference with the normal and usual activities apart from gainful employment.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 35 does not limit the recovery of economic damages, defined by the measure to be all objectively verifiable monetary losses including but not limited to reasonable charges necessarily incurred for medical, hospital, nursing and rehabilitative services and other health care services, burial and memorial expenses, loss of income and past and future impairment of earning capacity, reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for substitute domestic services, recurring loss to an estate and damage to reputation that is economically verifiable.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 35 provides for adjustment in the amount of the limitation based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers Not Seasonally Adjusted in the West Urban area, as published by the United States Department of Labor.

1880,Oregon,2004,Amends Medical Marijuana Act:  Requires Marijuana Dispensaries for Supplying Patients/Caregivers; Raises Patients' Possession Limit,"Ballot Measure 33 allows the creation of licensed non-profit dispensaries regulated by the Oregon Department of Human Services to produce, possess, and sell marijuana to registered patients and/or caregivers. The measure requires dispensaries to pay license fees, keep records, submit monthly reports, be subject to inspection, and pay 10-20% of gross revenue to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program to fund the program. The measure requires a program for indigent patients to receive medical marijuana at no cost from licensed dispensaries. Dispensaries must distribute to indigent patients an amount at least 20% of the dollar amount sold to registered patients each month. Dispensaries must report monthly to the department how much medical marijuana was dispensed to indigent patients. Penalties for noncompliance will be established by the department. If no dispensary exists in a county within six months of passage of this measure, the department shall grant the county health department a medical marijuana dispensary license, waiving the signature and license fee requirements. Licensed dispensaries are subject to felony prosecution if they are found to be out of substantial compliance with the department's regulations or to have distributed marijuana to persons other than caregivers, patients, or other dispensaries.<BR>  <BR>  Current law allows a caregiver to serve an unlimited number of patients. The measure limits caregivers to serving up to 10 patients without a medical marijuana dispensary license. The measure allows designated medical marijuana caregivers to be compensated by their registry identification cardholders in any manner agreed on by both parties.<BR>  <BR>  The measure increases the amount of marijuana that may be possessed by a registered patient or designated medical marijuana caregiver to 10 marijuana plants and one pound of usable marijuana at any one time. However, if a registered patient or designated medical marijuana caregiver has provided information to the state demonstrating that the person is growing only one crop per year, that person may possess up to six pounds per patient immediately following that one harvest. With physician approval, patients may exceed statutory limits.<BR>  <BR>  The measure amends the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act to include licensed Naturopaths and Nurse Practitioners in the definition of ""attending physician"" for purposes of the Act. The measure expands ""debilitating medical condition"" to include any other medical condition for which the use of marijuana would benefit the patient as determined by the attending physician.<BR>  <BR>  The measure requires law enforcement agencies to contact the department prior to obtaining a search warrant in any marijuana investigation unless they have specific credible evidence that unlawful activity has occurred. The measure retains criminal penalties for non-medical use of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  The department shall promulgate rules to implement this act and shall establish the Oregon Medical Marijuana Commission to oversee the management of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program, administered by the department.

1882,Oregon,2004,"Governments Must Pay Owners, or Forgo Enforcement, When Certain Land Use Restrictions Reduce Property Value","Ballot Measure 37 adds a new statute to ORS chapter 197. As specified in the measure, the owner of private real property is entitled to receive just compensation when a land use regulation is enacted after the owner or a family member became the owner of the property if the regulation restricts the use of the property and reduces its fair market value.<BR>  <BR>  If a property owner proves that a land use regulation restricts the use of the owner's property, and reduces its value then the government responsible for the regulation will have a choice: pay the owner of the property an amount equal to the reduction in value or modify, change or not apply the regulation to the owner's property.<BR>  <BR>  The measure allows the state, county, city or metropolitan service district to adopt procedures for processing claims for compensation, but prohibits those procedures from being treated as a prerequisite to the filing of a claim in circuit court.<BR>  <BR>  The measure does not apply to commonly and historically recognized public nuisances, public health and safety regulations, regulations required to comply with federal law, and regulations restricting or prohibiting the use of a property for the purpose of selling pornography or performing nude dancing.<BR>  <BR>  The measure specifies that compensation is due if the regulation remains in force 180 days after the owner makes written demand for compensation.

The board is given authority to protect, manage, utilize and conserve forestlands. The board may sell forest products from the lands as well as seek the protection of fish and wildlife, recreation and water supply. The statutes provide no ranking or preference for one use over another.<BR>  <BR>  The measure requires management of state forests by defining ""permanent value"" as a balance between sustainable timber production and water, wildlife, watershed protection, recreation, and forest restoration to provide the greatest economic, social, environmental and health benefits to the people of this state.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 34 requires the Board to manage the Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests specifically for the purpose of restoring native old growth forests in half of those two forests. The other half would be managed for sustainable timber and revenue production in a way that is at least as protective as what is required under the current State Forest Management Plan.<BR>  <BR>  An Independent Restoration Science Team is created to review and recommend necessary changes to the current forest plan to comply with the standards in the measure. Team members will be selected by the chairs of the biology departments at Oregon's three largest universities. The team must determine the areas best suited for permanent restoration of native old growth forest. The team shall submit its recommendations to the board, which may reject them after a public hearing. The measure requires the board to adopt a new forest plan for the Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests, with a periodic review to ensure that restoration standards are being met.<BR>  <BR>  Current law distributes revenues derived from the timber harvest in the Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests under a formula. If the counties agree to modification of the formula, 10 percent of the revenue over 10 years will be used to pay for forest management of the restoration area and for amendment of the forest plan. If the counties do not agree, the State Forestry Department will provide management funds from other state timber revenue.<BR>  <BR>  Public schools in the affected counties shall not receive less revenue than received in 2002-2003 because of any formula modification.

1885,Oregon,2006,Allows Income Tax Deduction Equal to Federal Exemptions Deduction to Substitute for State Exemption Credit,"Ballot Measure 41 changes how state income taxes are calculated. Currently, Oregon taxpayers may take a personal exemption tax credit ($154 for 2005) for each exemption allowed under federal tax law. Typically a taxpayer may take a credit for him or herself, a spouse and each dependent. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of taxes owed. This tax credit is adjusted for the cost of living each year.<BR>  <BR>  This Measure gives Oregon taxpayers the option of taking a tax deduction equal to the amount deducted on federal taxes. In contrast to a tax credit, a tax deduction is an amount that is subtracted from gross income to determine the amount of income that is subject to tax, or ""taxable income."" Currently, federal law allows taxpayers to take a deduction ($3,200 in 2005) for each personal exemption allowed under federal law. Typical exemptions are for the taxpayer, the spouse and dependents. The federal personal income exemption is adjusted for the cost of living each year.<BR>  <BR>  This Measure permits a taxpayer to claim either the new deduction created in this Measure or the existing personal exemption credit, if the existing credit would result in a lower tax for the taxpayer.<BR>  <BR>  Existing federal law sets forth many exemptions from federal income tax that are unrelated to the deduction for personal exemptions. This Measure provides that the new state deduction shall not be less than the total amount of the deduction allowed for all exemptions on the taxpayer federal tax return but does not contain a definition of all exemptions.<BR>  <BR>  This Measure is a statutory measure, not a Constitutional amendment. This Measure states that a repeal, delay in implementation or decrease in the amount of the deduction allowed would be subject to existing provisions of the Oregon Constitution requiring a supermajority vote for tax increases and prohibiting a bill regulating taxation or exemption from taking effect immediately following enactment through a declaration of an emergency.<BR>  <BR>  This Measure will reduce general fund revenue for a variety of state funded programs. The impact of the measure on state revenue will be greater each successive year because the federal deduction is indexed for inflation. The Measure would reduce tax revenue for 2006, and it may have an impact on current budgets.

The four exceptions are: 1) real property that is a danger to health or safety for specified reasons; 2) timber, crops, topsoil, gravel or fixtures that can be removed from the real property being condemned; 3) real property to be used for transportation or utility-related projects; and 4) real property acquired by a new owner after the government publishes a notice that it intends to consider condemning the real property.<BR>  <BR>  In addition to these four exceptions, Measure 39 authorizes the government to use the real property to secure financing for the property's acquisition and to lease portions of the property for retail uses that serve patrons of the public facility.<BR>  <BR>  If a property owner believes the government's condemnation of the property violates Measure 39 the property owner may object to the condemnation. Under Measure 39 the court must determine on its own, without deferring to the decision of the local government, whether the government's condemnation violates the new provisions of Measure 39. If the court determines the government's condemnation does not satisfy the new requirements of Measure 39, then the property owner is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees, costs, expenses and other disbursements.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 39 also modifies current condemnation procedures contained in Oregon Law. Currently, when the government decides to condemn private real property, the government must provide the property owner with an initial offer for purchasing the private real property. If the property owner rejects the government's initial offer additional offers may be made. If agreement is not reached the case proceeds to trial. If the property owner receives a verdict above the highest offer made by the government at least 30 days prior to the beginning of trial, the property owner is entitled to recover attorney fees, costs and other disbursements.<BR>  <BR>  Measure 39 modifies the condemnation process by allowing an owner of private real property to recover attorney fees costs and other disbursements if the judgment awarded at trial exceeds the initial offer of compensation offered by the government even if the government subsequently made a higher offer.<BR>  [S]",Measure 39,Initiative,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.6709999999999999,Amendment,1

1897,Oregon,2008,Amends Constitution: Changes Operative Date Of Redistricting Plans; Allows Affected Legislators To Finish Term In Original District,"The Oregon Constitution requires the adjustment of the legislative district boundaries for the offices of state Senator and state Representative every 10 years after the United States census is taken. This process is known as redistricting or reapportionment.<BR>  <BR>  This measure amends the Oregon Constitution to change the date that the redistricting plan first applies, or becomes operative.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the constitution requires the Legislative Assembly to adopt a redistricting plan by July 1 of the year following the census (an odd-numbered year). If the legislature does not adopt a plan, the Secretary of State must file a redistricting plan with the Oregon Supreme Court by August 15 of the same year.  The constitution allows for legal challenges to any redistricting plan and requires that a plan be operative no later than December 15 of the same year.<BR>  <BR>  Since the redistricting plan goes into operation during legislative terms of office, this means that incumbent members of the legislature must be assigned to represent the new legislative districts for the remainder of their terms. State Representatives may represent an assigned district for more than one year. State Senators may represent an assigned district for more than two years.<BR>  <BR>  This measure changes the date that the new redistricting plan becomes operative to the first day of the next regular legislative session that occurs after the plan is developed. Therefore, most members of the legislature could continue to represent the districts from which they were elected or appointed until the end of their terms. Some state Senators would have to be assigned to a new district for the final two years of their term of office.<BR>  <BR>  However, the measure also provides that the new legislative districts would apply for purposes of nominating and electing members of the legislature at the primary and general elections in the even-numbered year after the final redistricting plan was developed.<BR>  <BR>  Therefore, this measure allows the new legislative districts to apply for purposes of nominating and electing candidates from the new legislative districts, but does not require most incumbent members of the legislature to be assigned to and represent new legislative districts that are different from the districts from which they were elected or appointed.<BR>  <BR>  Note: The explanatory statement for Measure 55 was provided by the 2007 Legislature as part of House Bill 2640.",Measure 55,Legislative Referendum,Legislatures,General,0.774,,1

1901,Oregon,2008,Amends Constitution: Provides That May And November Property Tax Elections Are Decided By Majority Of Voters Voting,"Under current law, local governments may ask voters to approve certain local property tax measures to raise money to help fund local government services, such as education, jails, police and fire, libraries and parks. Local governments may also ask voters to approve serial or bond levies to pay for capital projects, such as building new schools, roads, libraries, parks and other public facilities.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, the Oregon Constitution requires that at least 50 percent of qualified voters must vote, and a majority of those voters must approve the measure, in order to pass a local property tax measure. The only exception to the 50 percent turnout requirement is for November elections held in even-numbered years.<BR>  <BR>  Under the 50 percent voter turnout requirement, often referred to as a ""double majority"" requirement, non-votes have the effect of a ""no"" vote if less than 50 percent of qualified voters participate in the election. An example demonstrates how current law works. Assume:<BR>  Number of qualified voters in jurisdiction: 1,000,000<BR>  Voters who voted: 499,999<BR>  ""Yes"" vote: 499,999 (100% of those who voted)<BR>  ""No"" vote: 0<BR>  Voters who did not vote: 500,001<BR>  Result: Measure fails; non-votes have effect of ""no"" vote<BR>  <BR>  The voter turnout requirement only applies to certain local property tax measures, such as ""local option"" taxes, serial levies and bond levies.

A citizen meeting these qualifications would be allowed to vote in the school election if the citizen also could read and write English.<BR>  <BR>  Later developments in voting rights laws and in court decisions interpreting the United States Constitution have made each of these requirements unconstitutional or a violation of federal law. The 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents denial or abridgment of the voting rights of a citizen 18 years of age or older. Federal court decisions have held that residency requirements of the type set forth in section 6, Article VIII of the Oregon Constitution, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Oregon's Attorney General in 1972 held that the requirement is unenforceable. Finally, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 generally prohibits literacy tests as a condition for eligibility to vote.<BR>  <BR>  This measure repeals Section 6, Article VIII of the Oregon Constitution, so that Oregon's requirements for voting in school elections do not violate federal law and the United States Constitution.

Ballot Measure 69 amends the Oregon Constitution to allow lowest cost general obligation bonds from Article XI-F(1) and Article XI-G to be used for these expansions into existing buildings, not just new facilities.<BR>  <BR>  Articles XI-F(1) and XI-G of the Oregon Constitution were adopted in 1950 and 1964, respectively. Since then, the roles and nature of higher education institutions have evolved beyond traditional instruction into areas of research, public service and economic development. Ballot Measure 69 would eliminate outdated provisions and unambiguously allow Oregon to issue general obligation bonds for the types of facilities used by today's community colleges and public universities.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 69 would make it clear that community colleges and public universities could finance projects that benefit higher education institutions or activities. Current constitutional language may limit the projects that may be financed with bonds issued under Articles XI-F(1) and XI-G of the Oregon Constitution. Existing language does not specifically authorize the state to use these lower cost bonds to purchase existing buildings that are less expensive than new construction. Existing language further raises questions about the types of projects that can be financed with general obligation bonds issued under Articles XI-F(1) and XI-G.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 69 continues the requirement that Oregon University System have enough revenues to pay for bonds issued under Article XI-F(1). Current language in Article XI-F(1) of the Oregon Constitution requires projects financed with bonds authorized by this Article to be entirely self-supporting through revenues, gifts, grants or building fees. Ballot Measure 69 changes existing language to allow moneys used to support such projects to originate from any source other than tax revenues appropriated from the General Fund. The measure would also eliminate confusing language that interferes with financing mixed-use projects with proceeds from bonds issued under both Articles XI-F(1) and XI-G of the Oregon Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Current language in the Oregon Constitution requires that Article XI-G bonds be matched by an identical amount of other funds.

This measure repeals the requirement for a vote in 2014 and continues the dedication.  It also continues the equal division of the Fund between the two subaccounts described above.

In 1944, by legislative referral, voters amended the Oregon Constitution to create the ‘Oregon War Veterans' Fund’ to provide low-interest home loans to some Oregon residents who served in the United States Armed Forces and their surviving spouses.<BR>  <BR>  The Oregon Constitution currently requires that, to be eligible for a loan from the Oregon War Veterans' Fund, a person must have honorably served in active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States for 210 consecutive days (unless discharged from active duty due to service-related illness or injury) or must have seen combat. The person also must have been honorably discharged or separated from the Armed Forces. The veteran must apply for the loan within 30 years after the veteran was released from active duty. Loans are for primary residences and are made only to those who can show an ability to repay. Surviving spouses of veterans who died, became missing in action or became prisoners of war while in service also are eligible to receive loans under certain conditions.<BR>  <BR>  Because veterans must apply for loans within 30 years of discharge, many Vietnam-era combat veterans who were honorably discharged are no longer eligible for the loans.  Because of the requirement that a veteran serve for 210 consecutive days, many Oregon veterans who served in the military after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and were honorably discharged are not eligible for the loans.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would make the loans available to any Oregon veteran who has served under honorable conditions on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States, as long as the veteran meets certain financial eligibility criteria. The measure uses the same definition of ""veteran"" as is used in Oregon law. The measure eliminates the constitutional requirement that loans be applied for within 30 years of discharge, making eligibility for a loan a lifetime benefit for veterans, as long as they meet the other qualification criteria. This measure also eliminates the requirement that a veteran serve for 210 continuous days. Under Oregon law, a person would be a ""veteran"" if the person completed at least 178 consecutive days of service or saw combat, and received an honorable discharge. This measure also makes the loans available to surviving spouses of veterans, regardless of whether the veteran resided in Oregon, if the deceased veteran meets certain eligibility criteria and the surviving spouse resides in Oregon at the time of application for the loan.<BR>  <BR>  If this measure were to pass, more Oregon veterans and surviving spouses would be eligible to receive a low-interest home loan through the Oregon War Veterans' Fund.",Measure 70,Legislative Referendum,Military & Veterans Affairs,General,0.8440000000000001,Amendment,1

1921,Oregon,2010,Revises Constitution: Allows State To Issue Bonds To Match Voter Approved School District Bonds For School Capital Costs,"May 18, 2010 primary.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Explanatory Statement</B><BR>  The Oregon Constitution restricts the state's authority to issue bonds or otherwise incur indebtedness. Oregon voters have approved 16 exceptions to this restriction, 14 of which are still in effect. The exceptions allow the state to issue bonds for a variety of purposes, including for home ownership loans to veterans, reforestation of state lands, construction of buildings for state universities and community colleges, housing for the elderly and disabled, pollution controls and seismic rehabilitation of public buildings. However, the restriction in the Constitution still prevents the state from issuing bonds or otherwise incurring indebtedness to assist local school districts in financing K-12 capital costs. The Constitution also limits the bonding authority of local taxing districts, including school districts.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would revise the Oregon Constitution to allow the state to issue general obligation bonds to match voter approved bonds for K-12 school capital costs. The measure would accomplish this by adding two different provisions to the Constitution. The first new provision would allow local taxing districts to incur bonded indebtedness on or after January 1, 2011, to finance capital costs. Capital costs are defined to include the costs of land and other assets associated with acquisition, construction, improvement, remodeling, maintenance and repair. Capital costs do not include operating costs.<BR>  <BR>  The second new provision would allow the state to issue general obligation bonds to provide funds to be granted or loaned to school districts to finance the capital costs of the school districts. The proceeds from the bonds could be used only to provide matching funds to finance the capital costs of school districts that have received voter approval to issue local government bonds. The state bonds may not be used to pay school district operating costs. Bonds issued by the state could not be repaid through property taxes.<BR>  <BR>  This new constitutional provision also creates a ""school capital matching fund"" to pay for matching funds to school districts to finance capital costs and debt service on state bonds issued pursuant to this measure and repeals the current ""school capital matching subaccount"" in the ""education stability fund."" Any existing funds in the school capital matching subaccount would be transferred to the new school capital matching fund, and that fund also would receive 15 percent of net lottery proceeds.<BR>  <BR>  Under the measure, if residents of a local taxing district vote to approve bonds for school capital costs, the local taxing district would be eligible to receive matching funds from the state. This would allow the state to help pay for K-12 capital costs. The result would substantially reduce the costs to the local school district and its taxpayers to make capital improvements, such as constructing, repairing or maintaining school buildings.",Measure 68,Legislative Referendum,Education: PreK-12,Primary,0.6509999999999999,Amendment,1

1923,Oregon,2012,"Amends Constitution: Allocates Corporate Income/Excise Tax ""Kicker"" Refund To Additionally Fund K Through 12 Public Education","Ballot Measure 85 changes the ""corporate kicker"" provision of the Oregon Constitution. Under current law, certain excess corporate income and excise tax revenues collected during a biennium are returned to corporate taxpayers. Under Ballot Measure 85, the excess revenues would be retained in the state's General Fund and used to provide additional funding for kindergarten through twelfth grade public education. The Legislature has full discretion over how it allocates General Fund moneys, including the total amount of General Fund moneys to kindergarten through twelfth grade public education.<BR>  <BR>  The Oregon Constitution describes how the ""corporate kicker"" process works. First, at the beginning of each biennium the Governor estimates tax revenues that will be received by the state’s General Fund during the biennium. Estimated revenues from corporate income and excise taxes are determined separate from other General Fund revenues. The General Fund is where most individual and corporate income tax revenues are deposited. The General Fund pays for state services, including schools, prisons and social services. The biennium is the two-year period for which the state budget is prepared. The biennium runs from July 1 of each odd-numbered year to June 30 of the next odd-numbered year.<BR>  <BR>  Second, at the end of each biennium budget, the Governor determines the revenues actually received by the General Fund. Again, revenues received from corporate income and excise taxes are determined separately from other General Fund revenues.<BR>  <BR>  Finally, if revenues actually received by the General Fund from corporate income and excise taxes are at least two percent greater than what was estimated, the excess currently are returned, or ""kicked back,"" to the corporate income and excise taxpayers.<BR>  <BR>  Ballot Measure 85 amends the Oregon Constitution to provide the ""corporate kicker"" be retained in the General Fund and used to provide additional funding for public education, kindergarten through twelfth grade. The excess revenues would no longer be returned to the corporate income and excise taxpayers. The Legislature has full discretion over how it allocates General Fund moneys, including the total amount of General Fund moneys to kindergarten through twelfth grade public education.<BR>  <BR>  The Oregon Constitution contains ""kicker"" provisions for both corporate income and excise taxpayers and personal income taxpayers. Ballot Measure 85 does not affect the “kicker” for personal income taxpayers.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Estimate of Financial Impact Statement</B><BR>  <BR>  The financial impact of this measure is indeterminate because it is affected by unknown future events. If corporation tax receipts exceed the state forecast by two percent or more for a two-year budget period beginning July 2013 or later, this measure will increase the amount retained in the state General Fund relative to current law.

Ballot summary: ""Joint Resolution No. 2021-1 proposes adding a new section to Article IV of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This amendment incorporates disaster emergency declaration and management powers directly into the Constitution by:    Granting the Governor authority to declare a disaster emergency declaration by proclamation or executive order;  Requiring each declaration to indicate the nature, location and type of disaster;  Granting the General Assembly authority to pass laws providing for the manner in which each disaster shall be managed;  Limiting the duration of a Governor’s declaration to 21 days, unless otherwise extended, in whole or in part, by a concurrent resolution of the General Assembly;  Preventing the Governor, upon the expiration of a declaration, from issuing a new declaration based upon the same or substantially similar facts, unless the General Assembly passes a concurrent resolution expressly approving a new declaration.  Currently, disaster emergency declaration and management powers are delegated by statute to the Governor. The Governor has the sole authority to issue and manage all disaster emergency declarations, which cannot extend beyond 90 days unless renewed by the Governor. The General Assembly may override a Governor’s disaster emergency declaration by concurrent resolution that must be presented to the Governor for his approval or veto.    If approved, the amendment would transfer certain of the Governor’s existing authority to respond to and manage disaster emergencies to the General Assembly. The Governor would retain the authority to issue an initial disaster emergency declaration but the declaration’s permissible length would be reduced from 90 to 21 days. The sole authority to extend a declaration would lie with the General Assembly; presently, this power rests with the Governor.    Upon expiration of the initial declaration, the amendment prohibits the Governor from issuing a new declaration based upon the same or substantially similar facts without the approval of the General Assembly. The Governor would no longer have unilateral authority to manage disasters, but would have to do so consistent with the laws passed by the General Assembly.    If approved, the General Assembly would be required to pass new laws establishing the manner in which each type of disaster shall be managed.

Ballot summary: ""Joint Resolution No. 2021-1, if approved by the electorate, will add a new section to Article I of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This amendment creates a constitutional prohibition against restricting or denying an individual’s equal rights under Pennsylvania law because of race or ethnicity.    Generally, inclusion of this amendment within the Pennsylvania Constitution signifies that freedom from discrimination based on race or ethnicity is an essential principle of liberty and free government. This amendment applies to all Pennsylvania state, county and local governmental entities, and guarantees equality of rights under the law. The amendment, if enacted, will become a part of the Pennsylvania Constitution. As such, its provisions must be applied consistent with the other provisions of the Constitution.    This equal right to be free from racial or ethnic discrimination will exist independent from any such rights under the United States Constitution or corresponding federal law. If the current federal protections proscribing racial or ethnic discrimination are abolished, the prohibition against such discrimination will remain in the Pennsylvania Constitution. The amendment is limited in that it creates a right only under Pennsylvania law.    Once added to the Pennsylvania Constitution, the right to be free from racial or ethnic discrimination under the law cannot be eliminated except by a judicial decision finding the amendment unconstitutional or the approval of a subsequent constitutional amendment.

Ballot summary: ""Joint Resolution No. 2021-1 proposes to amend Article III, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution to provide a new exception to traditional legislative procedure by allowing the General Assembly to terminate or extend a disaster emergency declaration or a portion of such declaration without needing the Governor’s approval.    Currently, Article III, Section 9 establishes a general rule that all orders, resolutions or votes requiring approval by both the House of Representatives and Senate must be presented to the Governor for his approval or veto. Resolutions for the adjournment of the General Assembly are exempted from this process. If the order, resolution or vote is approved by the Governor, it becomes law. If the Governor vetoes the resolution, it does not become law unless two-thirds of the House and Senate vote to override the veto. The proposed amendment would create an additional exception to this customary legislative procedure for concurrent resolutions to terminate or extend, in whole or in part, a disaster emergency declaration issued by the Governor.    The proposed amendment will also have the effect of reversing a recent ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which held the Pennsylvania Constitution prohibited the General Assembly from passing a concurrent resolution to terminate the Governor’s Covid-19 disaster emergency declaration without presenting it to the Governor for his approval. It will change the law to allow the General Assembly to terminate or extend a disaster emergency declaration through a concurrent resolution approved by only a majority of the members of the House and Senate, without having to present the resolution to the Governor for his approval or veto.    The proposed amendment is limited in that it only changes the traditional legislative process for terminating or extending disaster emergency declarations issued by the Governor.

A vote to ""Reject"" means that you are opposed to the constitutional changes proposed.<BR>  <BR>  The Governor offers the following explanation of his question:  The text of Article 6, Section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution reads as follows: ""The general assembly shall continue to exercise the powers it has heretofore exercised, unless prohibited in this Constitution.""  The Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that this section preserves to the General Assembly broad powers granted to it by King Charles II of England in the Royal Charter of 1663 and creates in Rhode Island ""a quintessential system of parliamentary supremacy,"" rather than the traditional American system of separate and coequal branches of government.<BR>  <BR>  Along with the elimination of this section, my question also asks whether the Constitution should be changed to expressly provide that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of Rhode Island government are to be separate and co-equal consistent with the American system of government.<BR>  <BR>  This referendum is advisory only. A favorable vote will not necessarily result in constitutional change.

An amendment to the Constitution accomplishing the proposed changes can be adopted by the General Assembly at any time and presented to the voters at any general election. The State Constitution requires that the Secretary of State place a binding question of whether a Constitutional Convention should be called before the voters at the general election in 2004. No change to the Rhode Island Constitution can take effect until it has been submitted to and approved by the voters as a result of a proposed amendment or as recommended by a Constitutional Convention.<BR>  <BR>  This question has been proposed by Governor Lincoln Almond pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Section 17-5-2, which gives the Governor the power to order the Secretary of State to submit to the electors at any election such questions as the Governor shall deem necessary.",Question 5,Other,Judiciary,General,0.758,,1

Under the Texas Constitution, land that is not included in a patented  survey or dedicated for another purpose is dedicated to the permanent school fund. A person may not receive a patent on land dedicated to the fund unless the General Land Office and the School Land Board, which manage the fund for the benefit of educational programs, receive fair market value for the land. Land that is not included in a patented survey  is known as a vacancy.<BR>  <BR>  The tracts covered by the proposed amendment are part of a vacancy identified in 1925 as part of the A. P. Nance Survey. Although the land was surveyed, a patent was not issued for the land by the General Land Office. Some owners of property adjoining the vacancy purchased portions of the vacancy, and others have occupied, fenced, and paid taxes on  portions of the vacancy. In 1999, the General Land Office resurveyed the A. P. Nance Survey and identified persons occupying land dedicated to the permanent school fund. While several title insurance companies have since paid the fair market value of portions of the land included in the  vacancy, the status of 127 acres of land held by 20 individuals who are not covered by title insurance remains unresolved.<BR>  <BR>  In 1981, 1991, and 1993, voters approved constitutional amendments that remedied title defects for certain landowners in other areas of the state. Those amendments allowed the General Land Office to issue patents to qualified applicants whose land titles were defective. The proposed amendment would clear title to tracts of land in the A. P. Nance Survey for which the status is unresolved by relinquishing and releasing any claim of the state of sovereign ownership or title to an interest, other than a mineral interest, in those tracts.

In an effort to avoid a similar controversy in Texas in future presidential elections, the legislature  proposes a specific constitutional amendment to provide for a special legislative session as a sure method of retaining state control over the appointment of electors if it appears that challenges may delay a final determination on the appointment until after the legal deadline for the  state to make that determination.",Amendment 6,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.622,,1

2294,Utah,2000,Create a tobacco settlement trust fund,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Proposition 2 amends the Utah Constitution to establish a permanent state trust fund whose assets are to be preserved and invested by the state treasurer, as provided by statute. The trust fund consists of: (1) money designated by statute or appropriation from proceeds that the state receives from the November 1998 settlement agreement between the state and leading tobacco manufacturers; and (2) any money and assets that the trust fund receives through a will or other private donation.<BR>  <BR>  This proposition requires the income from the trust fund to be deposited into the General Fund of the state. Once placed in the General Fund, that money would be subject to legislative appropriation on the same basis as other General Fund money. The proposition provides that money or assets in the trust fund may be removed from the trust fund and deposited into the state's General Fund only if the governor and three-fourths of both the Senate and the House of Representatives agree.<BR>  <BR>  If Proposition 2 passes, certain provisions of S.B.15, Use of Tobacco Settlement Revenues, 2000 General Session, will become law on January 1, 2001. Those provisions require 50% of all money received by the state related to the November 1998 tobacco settlement agreement to be deposited into the permanent state trust fund established by Proposition 2. The percentage of tobacco settlement money to be deposited into the trust fund would increase to 60% as of July 1, 2003.

Initiative A requires any state funds affected by its implementation to remain in the state's General Fund, requires an accounting of those funds, and authorizes the Legislature to appropriate those funds for programs for English as a second language.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative A declares English to be the official language of Utah. It makes English the sole language of government, but allows a language other than English to be used when required:<BR>  a.  by the Utah or federal constitution or federal law or regulation;<BR>  b.  by law enforcement or for public health and safety needs;<BR>  c.  to comply with rules made by the State Board of Education or State Board of Regents as required under Initiative A;<BR>  d.  in judicial proceedings, when necessary to insure that justice is served;<BR>  e.  to promote and encourage tourism and economic development, including the hosting of events such as the Olympics; and<BR>  f.  by libraries to collect and promote foreign language materials and to provide foreign language services and activities.<BR>  <BR>  Subject to those exceptions, Initiative A requires all official documents, transactions, proceedings, meetings, and publications of the state and its political subdivisions to be in English.

2296,Utah,2000,Relating to local government,"Legislative Constitutional Amendment<BR>  Proposition 1 amends several state and local government provisions of the Utah Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  1.  Modify terms used to identify certain local government entities.  The Utah Constitution uses the phrase ""Municipal and School officers"" when referring to local government officers that are the subject of a provision relating to the time of their election.  Proposition 1 changes that phrase to ""officers of each city, town, school district, and other political subdivisions of the State.""  The effect of this change is to identify more precisely the local government entities to which this provision applies and to broaden its application to include political subdivisions of the state whose officers are elected, such as certain special districts that provide water services, sewer services, etc.  The Utah Constitution allows voters of any ""legal subdivision"" to initiate any desired legislation or to require legislation passed by the lawmaking body of the ""legal subdivision"" to be submitted to voters before taking effect.  Proposition 1 replaces the term ""legal subdivision"" with ""county, city, or town.""  Under this proposition, counties, cities, and towns would be the only local government entities whose voters would be able to initiate legislation or require legislation passed by the local lawmaking body to be submitted to voters before it may take effect.  The Utah Constitution prohibits ""corporations for municipal purposes"" from being created by a law with specific rather than general application. Proposition 1 replaces the phrase ""corporations for municipal purposes"" with the phrase ""cities or towns.""  The Utah Constitution prohibits the Legislature from imposing taxes for the purpose of any county, city, town, ""or other municipal corporation.""  Proposition 1 replaces the more narrow term ""municipal corporation"" with the broader term ""political subdivision of the State.""  The Utah Constitution empowers the Legislature to authorize a county, city, or town to establish special districts. Proposition 1 changes the terminology of that provision from ""special district"" to ""special service district."" Because the term ""special district"" includes a larger class of local governmental entities than the term ""special service district,"" Proposition 1 may narrow the class of entities affected by the constitutional provision containing that terminology.<BR>  <BR>  2.  Expand the types of services provided by special service districts.  The Utah Constitution lists nine services that a special district may provide.  Proposition 1 eliminates the list of nine services and replaces it with more expansive language stating that special service districts may provide whatever services they are allowed by statute to provide.<BR>  <BR>  3.  Authorize the Legislature to provide for the establishment of additional local government entities   Proposition 1 explicitly authorizes the Legislature to provide for the establishment of political subdivisions or other governmental entities, in addition to counties, cities, towns, school districts, and special service districts. It also provides that those political subdivisions or other governmental entities may provide services and facilities, exercise powers, and perform functions as provided by statute.<BR>  <BR>  4. Modify county seat and optional forms of county government provisions.  The Utah Constitution imposes certain conditions on the removal or relocation of a county seat. Proposition 1 replaces the removal and relocation language with language relating to any effort to ""move"" a county seat, while preserving the two-thirds vote requirement presently in the constitution.  This proposition also gives the Legislature greater flexibility in providing for optional forms of county government.  The adoption of an optional form of   government by a county would continue to require county voter approval.<BR>  <BR>  5. Provide for municipal dissolution.  The Utah Constitution requires the Legislature to provide for the incorporation, organization, and classification of cities and towns. Proposition 1 also requires the Legislature to provide for their dissolution.<BR>  <BR>  6. Clarify election provisions.  The Utah Constitution states that all general elections shall be held in November. Proposition 1 confirms current practice and clarifies that general elections are held in November of even-numbered years.  The Utah Constitution provides that legislation initiated by the people is to be submitted to a vote of the people for approval or rejection. Proposition 1 clarifies that, except for an initiative on wildlife, the vote required to pass legislation initiated by the people is ""a majority vote of those voting on the legislation."" An initiative on wildlife would continue to require a vote of two-thirds of those voting to pass.<BR>  <BR>  7. Modify the exclusive uses of specified highway revenues.  The Utah Constitution requires proceeds from the imposition of any license tax, registration fee, driver education tax, or other charge related to the operation of a motor vehicle and the proceeds from the imposition of an excise tax on gasoline to be used exclusively for specific highway purposes stated in the constitution, including the construction, improvement, repair, and maintenance of roads. Proposition 1 provides that those highway purposes include the repayment of debt incurred for the construction, improvement, repair, and maintenance of roads. Proposition 1 also eliminates ""tourists and publicity expense"" as one of the highway purposes for which the proceeds must be used.<BR>  <BR>  8. Repeal redundant or obsolete language.  Proposition 1 repeals language in the Utah Constitution that is redundant or obsolete. For example, it eliminates one of two almost identical provisions prohibiting the imposition of a property qualification on a person in order to   vote or hold office. In addition, Proposition 1 deletes language in the Utah Constitution recognizing school districts as legal subdivisions of counties.  School districts are now widely acknowledged to be political subdivisions of the state.",Proposition 1,Legislative Referendum,Local Government,General,0.69,,1
2297,Utah,2000,Utah Property Protection Act,"Initiative Statute<BR>  Forfeiture background:<BR>   In the provisions of Utah law affected by Initiative B, the term forfeiture means the loss of ownership of property to the government because of the property's involvement in the commission of a crime.  Forfeiture is typically preceded by seizure, which is a government agency taking into custody the property sought to be forfeited.  Seizure results in the loss of the owner's possession of the property, while forfeiture is the actual loss of ownership.<BR>  <BR>  In order for a forfeiture to occur, the government must prove all of the required elements of forfeiture.  After property has been forfeited, it belongs to the government, which may sell or otherwise dispose of the property.<BR>  <BR>  The crimes for which forfeiture is authorized under the provisions of Utah law amended by Initiative B are: racketeering, money laundering, gambling, fleeing police, wildlife poaching, felonies in which a firearm or explosive device is used, and crimes involving illegal drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol. There are different statutory forfeiture procedures and standards for each of these crimes.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative B modifies current forfeiture law by enacting provisions that apply to all situations where property is seized under a law subjecting the property to forfeiture. These provisions:<BR>  (1) require an agency seizing property to prepare an inventory of the seized property, notify the prosecuting attorney, and give written notice to all owners of the property;<BR>  (2) give an owner the right to:<BR>  (a) void a forfeiture if the owner was entitled to be notified but was not notified of a seizure, unless the agency shows good cause for the failure to notify or that the owner had actual notice;<BR>  (b) obtain the immediate release of seized property in specified hardship situations;<BR>  (c) a jury trial in civil forfeiture proceedings;<BR>  (d) sue a seizing agency for the negligent damage or loss of the seized property; and<BR>  (e) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit if the owner prevails on the forfeiture claim;<BR>  (3) include a procedure for the forfeiture of property involved in the commission of a crime and for a person claiming an interest in the property to challenge the forfeiture;<BR>  (4) prohibit the civil forfeiture of property owned by an ""innocent owner,"" defined in the Initiative as a person who owns or legitimately acquires property without knowledge of the crime subjecting the property to seizure or who took reasonable actions to prohibit the use of the property in the crime;<BR>  (5) give an indigent owner a right to an appointed attorney in forfeiture proceedings;<BR>  (6) increase, in most instances, the government's burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings;<BR>  (7) prohibit forfeiture unless the forfeiture is substantially proportional to both the use of the property in committing or facilitating the commission of the crime, and the value of the property;<BR>  (8) impose triple damages, court costs, and attorney's fees on an agency that violates provisions relating to the transfer of seized property to or sharing of seized property with a federal agency; and<BR>  (9) require proceeds from the sale of forfeited property to be deposited in the Uniform School Fund, after deducting the costs of maintaining and storing the forfeited property, administering the forfeiture proceeding, paying for an appointed attorney, and compensating victims of the conduct that led to the forfeiture.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative B makes conforming amendments to current statutes on forfeiture and related matters. These changes include:<BR>  (1) eliminating language providing for forfeiture proceeds to be distributed to:<BR>  (a) the Wildlife Resources Account;<BR>  (b) the state's General Fund;<BR>  (c) the Drug Forfeiture Account;<BR>  (d) the Financial Fraud and Money Laundering Forfeiture Account;<BR>  (e) the Department of Public Safety for training peace officers, funding public awareness programs, and aiding enforcement efforts to combat drug trafficking and financial criminal activity;<BR>  (f) an agency requesting the funds for drug enforcement; and<BR>  (g) a local government that prosecuted a gambling violation;<BR>  (2) eliminating a presumption that the owner of a vehicle involved in illegally fleeing police was the driver of the vehicle;<BR>  (3) making cars, boats, and planes used or intended for use to transport or facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, simple possession, or concealment of illegal drugs no longer subject to forfeiture, unless used or intended for use to facilitate the distribution or possession with intent to distribute illegal drugs;<BR>  (4) expanding the exception to property subject to forfeiture for a racketeering violation so that property exchanged or to be exchanged for services given to defend the criminal charges or any related criminal charges is not subject to forfeiture;<BR>  (5) eliminating a presumption that money, coins, and currency are subject to forfeiture if found close to illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia subject to forfeiture; and<BR>  (6) narrowing the class of racketeering defendants subject to an alternative fine and reducing the maximum allowable amount of that fine.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative B takes effect on March 20, 2001.<BR>  <BR>  The Legislative Fiscal Analyst estimates the following fiscal impacts from Initiative B for the next fiscal year:   - Currently annual revenue of approximately $1.5 million from the sale of forfeited property is used by state agencies and local governments for law enforcement. Under Initiative B, those revenues will no longer be available for this use. State agencies and local governments that use those forfeiture revenues will have to replace those revenues or reduce the level of law enforcement.<BR>  <BR>  In order for certain state agencies and local governments to be eligible for certain federal funds, federal law requires forfeiture revenues to be used for wildlife management and law enforcement functions. Because Initiative B prohibits the use of forfeiture revenues for those purposes, it is estimated that $10.6 million of federal funds will be at risk. State agencies and local governments that use those federal funds will have to replace any lost funds or reduce the level of services.",Initiative B,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.69,,1

2301,Utah,2002,Radioactive Waste Restrictions Act,"Citizen's State Initiative 1 changes Utah's regulatory and tax framework affecting the disposal and storage of radioactive waste.  It provides stricter regulations, certain prohibitions, and new and increased fees and taxes.  The initiative distributes 80 percent of all taxes on radioactive waste to education and 20 percent to an endowment to help alleviate homelessness and poverty.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative 1 makes the following changes to Utah law:<BR>  1. Restricts certain employment and lobbying.<BR>  2. Expands circumstances requiring Governor's and Legislature's approval.<BR>  3. Prohibits the approval of certain radioactive waste facilities and licenses.<BR>  4. Increases existing and imposes new taxes and fees on radioactive waste.<BR>  5. Uses radioactive waste taxes for education and the homeless and impoverished.<BR>  <BR>  Potential Conflicts with the U.S. Constitution or Utah Constitution:  A limited review of this initiative raises the following potential conflicts:<BR>  1) the three-year lobbying prohibition may conflict with the freedom of speech provision of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;<BR>  2) empowering the Endowment Authority to appropriate Endowment money may improperly delegate legislative authority in violation of Article V, Section 1 of the Utah Constitution; and<BR>  3) to the extent that this initiative restricts the Legislature from making appropriations or reducing funding levels of state-funded programs, it may conflict with the Legislature's constitutional power to appropriate state funds.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact<BR>  The revenue estimates described in this fiscal analysis depend on the continued viability of the radioactive waste disposal and storage industry in Utah.  The ability of the industry to continue operations at present levels may be affected by the fee, tax, and regulatory changes made by this initiative.<BR>  <BR>  The Legislative Fiscal Analyst estimates that if waste volumes continue at current levels, tax revenues from radioactive waste that would be used for education and for the homeless and impoverished could be approximately $208 million annually.  The estimated annual volume of radioactive waste is based on records submitted to the Department of Environmental Quality.<BR>  <BR>  Estimated revenue for impact reduction and community and economic development in Tooele County is $13,850,000.<BR>  <BR>  The fee generated for perpetual care and closure of the disposal site is estimated to be $13,850,000 annually.  That annual perpetual care fee would continue until $100 million is accumulated, when the requirement to pay the fee ends.<BR>  <BR>  The state General Fund will lose approximately $908,000 annually from radioactive waste taxes that under this initiative will now go to education and to the homeless and impoverished.  The required independent testing and oversight is estimated to cost $292,500 annually from the state General Fund.<BR>  <BR>  A one-time appropriation of $100,000 from the radioactive waste tax revenues will be made to the Utah State Tax Commission with no provision for reimbursement of ongoing costs of collections.  Estimated annual costs for required meetings of the Fund Board and Endowment Authority are $15,300.  A one-time expenditure of $80,400 from radioactive waste tax revenues will be needed to develop six required administrative rules.  It is assumed that local entities will accept the same administrative rules that are created by the Fund Board and Endowment Authority and will not require additional funds for their required rulemaking.",Initiative 1,Initiative,Environmental Protection,General,0.32,,0

2303,Utah,2002,Resolution on Investment of State School Fund and Uniform School Fund,"IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS<BR>  Constitutional Amendment 1 amends the Education Article of the Utah Constitution in two ways.  First, it repeals a provision requiring a portion of the interest earnings from the State School Fund to be kept in the Fund as a protection against the effects of inflation.  Second, the Amendment provides that dividends from investment of the Fund may be spent for the support of the public education system.<BR>  <BR>  Fiscal Impact<BR>  The Legislative Fiscal Analyst demonstrates the potential fiscal impact of Constitutional Amendment 1 by using figures from fiscal year 2000 as an example.  The 2000 fiscal year balance of the State School Fund was approximately $213 million.  That amount multiplied by the annual rate of inflation of 2.7% yields $5.7 million of interest earnings.  If Constitutional Amendment 1 had been in effect for fiscal year 2000, that $5.7 million would have been available to be spent to support the public education system rather than added to the fund's principal balance of $213 million.  Additionally, dividends for fiscal year 2000 were approximately $3.4 million.

The severance tax revenue subject to deposit into the trust fund does not include severance tax revenue that state law designates for use by Indian tribes.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Permanent state trust fund</I><BR>  There currently exists a permanent state trust fund, which was established under a 2001 amendment to the Utah Constitution. As provided in the Utah Constitution, money deposited into the trust fund may not be removed from the fund unless approved by the governor and three-fourths of the Senate and House of Representatives. Money in the trust fund is required to be invested for the benefit of the people of the state. Income earned on money in the fund is required to be deposited into the state's General Fund to be used for general state purposes, as determined by the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  <I>Severance tax</I><BR>  Under current Utah law, the state imposes and collects a tax, called a severance tax, on those who remove oil, gas, or minerals from land within the state. The tax is based on the amount of oil, gas, or minerals removed. Some of the severance tax revenue generated from oil and gas removed from Indian lands is set aside to be used for the benefit of Indian tribes in the state. The remainder of severance tax revenue is placed in the state's General Fund to be used for general state purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The total amount of severance tax revenue over the past ten years, not including the revenue used for Indian tribes averages about $70 million annually. State law currently requires annual severance tax revenue exceeding a threshold of about $105 million to be deposited into the permanent state trust fund. In 2009, about $23 million of severance tax revenue was deposited into the trust fund under that requirement and a lower threshold then in effect.<BR>  <BR>  Currently the use of severance tax revenue is governed by statute enacted by the Legislature. The Utah Constitution does not mention severance taxes or specify how revenue from severance taxes is to be used.<BR>  <BR>  EFFECT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT A<BR>  Constitutional Amendment A requires a portion of the state's annual severance tax revenue, excluding severance tax revenue used for Indian tribes, to be deposited into the permanent state trust fund beginning July 1, 2016. The portion to be deposited into the trust fund is 25% of the first $50 million of annual severance tax revenue, 50% of the next $50 million, and 75% of all severance tax revenue over $100 million. By requiring that portion of severance tax revenue to be deposited into the permanent state trust fund rather than into the state's General Fund, the Amendment restricts the ability of the Legislature to determine how that portion of the state's annual severance tax revenue is to be used.",Constitutional Amendment A,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.505,,1

2345,Virginia,2000,Lottery Proceeds Fund,"In 1970, Virginia voters approved the repeal of a constitutional ban on state-run lotteries. In 1987, the General Assembly passed the law that established the present lottery system. That law also required voter approval, and voters did approve a state-operated lottery that November.<BR>  <BR>  The present Constitution does not specify how a lottery should be operated or how lottery revenues should be spent. These questions are decided by laws passed by the General Assembly. Under the present State Lottery Law, the State Lottery Department runs the lottery. The lottery revenues are used as the General Assembly provides by law and in the biennial budget and appropriation acts.<BR>  <BR>  Annual sales of lottery tickets in recent years have ranged from $900 million to $973 million. After prize payments and administrative costs, annual revenues to the Commonwealth have ranged from a low of $140 million in fiscal year 1989 to a high of $342.5 million in fiscal year 1997. The most recent turnover to the Commonwealth was $323.5 million in fiscal year 2000.<BR>  <BR>  The Commonwealth has used lottery proceeds in different ways spelled out by the General Assembly by law and in the biennial budget and appropriation acts. Proceeds in 1989 were used for capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the lottery proceeds were transferred to the Commonwealth's general fund. Starting in 1999, lottery proceeds were distributed to local public school divisions to be used solely for education purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment requires the General Assembly to establish a Lottery Proceeds Fund where the Commonwealth must put the net revenues from any state-run lottery. Lottery proceeds in the Fund must be distributed to counties, cities, and towns, and their school divisions, to be spent locally for public education. The General Assembly will no longer have the broad discretion it has now to appropriate the lottery profits for any public purpose.<BR>  <BR>  The General Assembly will be able to appropriate money from the Fund and not distribute it to the localities only in exceptional cases. Four-fifths of the members voting in each house of the General Assembly must agree to appropriate lottery proceeds from the Fund in such an exceptional case.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment requires localities to use the Fund money appropriated to them for public education purposes. A locality that accepts a share of the lottery proceeds must maintain its local share of education expenses to meet the state standards of quality for school divisions, without using lottery proceeds to do so. The amendment also requires the General Assembly to pass laws necessary to establish the Fund and implement the new constitutional provision.<BR>  <BR>  If the voters approve the proposed amendment, it will take effect July 1, 2001.",Constitutional Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.84,Amendment,1

The Commonwealth has the power to regulate hunting and fishing in the public's interest. The General Assembly has passed many laws to regulate hunting, fishing, and trapping. Examples of these laws and regulations include provisions for hunting and fishing permits and licenses and limits on the times and seasons for hunting and fishing.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment adds a statement to the Constitution that ""the people have a right to hunt, fish, and harvest game."" That right is subject to regulations and restrictions that the General Assembly enacts by general law.<BR>  <BR>  It will be the job of the General Assembly to define by law the scope of the right to hunt, fish, and harvest game and the limits on that right. Laws now regulating hunting and fishing will continue in effect subject to future changes passed by the General Assembly.<BR>  <BR>  If the voters approve the proposed amendment, it will take effect January 1, 2001.",Constitutional Amendment 2,Legislative Referendum,Animal Rights/Hunting & Fishing,General,0.6,Amendment,1

Virginia law requires a majority of voters in a statewide referendum to vote in favor of the Act before it can become effective.<BR>  <BR>  The purpose of the Act is to allow the Commonwealth to sell bonds to raise funds to pay for capital projects at state-supported colleges, universities, museums and other educational facilities.  The Constitution of Virginia in Section 9(b) of Article X provides that the General Assembly may authorize the creation of debt to pay for capital projects.  If this Act is approved, the Commonwealth may issue Commonwealth of Virginia General Obligation Bonds and sell the bonds to raise funds to pay for specific capital projects.  The capital projects contemplated in the Act have an estimated useful life of more than twenty-five years and include, but are not limited to, capital projects for the renovation of instructional facilities, construction of new academic space, construction of new research space, upgrades to heating and cooling systems, and improvements for handicapped accessibility.  The total amount of bonds the Commonwealth could issue pursuant to the Act is no more than $900,488,645 (nine hundred million, four hundred eighty-eight thousand, six hundred forty-five dollars), and no bond may be outstanding for more than twenty-five years.  The Act and related laws govern the details regarding the creation, issuance and repayment of the bonds, as well as the use of the funds generated by the sale of the bonds.

2348,Virginia,2002,Exempt Property,"Generally, the Constitution provides that all property shall be taxed and then provides how various types of property may be exempted from taxes.  This amendment changes how certain types of property may be exempted from taxes.<BR>  <BR>  Subsection (a) (6) of Article X, Section 6, now provides that the General Assembly may exempt property ""used by its owner for religious, charitable, patriotic, historical, benevolent, cultural, or public park and playground purposes.""<BR>  <BR>  This subsection provides that the General Assembly may exempt this category of property in either of two ways -- classification or designation.  First, it may pass a law to exempt property belonging to a class or type of organization.  It has passed a number of these laws.  For example, it has exempted the real and personal property that belongs to non-profit volunteer fire departments and rescue squads and is used for the benefit of the general public.<BR>  <BR>  Second, it may pass a law to exempt the property of a designated non-profit organization.  It has passed hundreds of these laws to exempt the property of specific, named organizations.  The General Assembly requires a resolution by the local governing body in support of the exemption.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment authorizes the local governing body to exempt such property by an ordinance and eliminates the need for action by the General Assembly.  The amendment provides that the local governing body may adopt an ordinance to exempt property ""used by its owner for religious, charitable, patriotic, historical, benevolent, cultural, or public park and playground purposes.""  The General Assembly will continue to have authority to enact laws setting out restrictions and conditions on these tax exemptions.<BR>  <BR>  A vote to approve this proposed amendment will provide for these tax exemptions to be authorized by the local governing body rather than by the General Assembly.

2349,Virginia,2002,Judicial Power and Jurisdiction,"This amendment concerns cases in which a person is convicted of a felony but is later able to prove his ""actual innocence"" because of new scientific or DNA evidence that is discovered after his conviction.  The new evidence shows that the person did not commit the felony and was wrongly convicted.<BR>  <BR>  The amendment provides that the Supreme Court may ""consider claims of actual innocence presented by convicted felons in such cases and in such manner as may be provided by the General Assembly"" as part of the Court's original jurisdiction.  Article VI, Section 1, establishes the Supreme Court and provides that it may hear some matters as part of its ""original"" jurisdiction and other matters as part of its ""appellate"" jurisdiction.<BR>  <BR>  Most cases reach the Supreme Court by an appeal from a lower court and fall within its ""appellate"" jurisdiction.  Section 1 lists the matters that the Supreme Court hears as part of its ""original"" jurisdiction.  These are special situations: for example, habeas corpus petitions and matters involving the discipline of a judge.<BR>  <BR>  A vote to approve this proposed amendment will make it clear that the Supreme Court may consider a claim of actual innocence without requiring the person to file the claim first in a lower court.  If the voters approve the proposed amendment, it will take effect November 15, 2002.<BR>  <BR>  The amendment provides that the General Assembly will provide by law for the details of what claims may be filed and the procedures that must be followed to file these claims.  The General Assembly has enacted a law to implement this proposed amendment.  That law will also take effect November 15, 2002.

The petition must claim that the petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, set out an exact description of the human biological or DNA evidence and testing supporting his innocence, and explain that the evidence was not available when the petitioner was convicted.

2351,Virginia,2004,Apportionment,"The proposed amendment clarifies provisions concerning the effective date and implementation of decennial redistricting laws.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment continues the requirement that the General Assembly must reapportion General Assembly and congressional districts every ten years in the year after a new federal census.  This reapportionment or redistricting is done by redrawing the district boundaries so that the populations in the districts are kept as equal as ""practicable.""  Redistricting is done to adjust district populations based on information from the new Census.<BR>  <BR>  The General Assembly redrew state Senate, House of Delegates, and congressional district lines in 2001 after the 2000 Census and will be required to redraw lines in 2011 after the 2010 Census and every ten years afterwards.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment restates the practice under the present Constitution and makes it clear that the redrawn districts will not be used until the November general election held immediately before the end of the terms being served in the year of the redistricting.  There were November elections from new districts in 2001 for the House of Delegates, 2002 for the United States House of Representatives, and 2003 for the state Senate as those terms ended in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment therefore states that the members in office when a decennial redistricting law is enacted shall complete their terms of office and continue to represent the districts from which they were elected for the duration of those terms of office.<BR>  <BR>  The question that led to this proposed amendment is which district to use when a vacancy occurs before those terms end.  After the 2001 redistricting, there were several vacancies in state Senate seats, and they were filled from new districts.  This solution created some confusion because both old and new districts were represented in the Senate at the same time.  Some people who had voted in the old district of the member who died or resigned were not voters in the new district and so did not have a representative in the state Senate for whom they had voted.  Other people living in the new district had voted in elections for two members of the state Senate -- one from the their old district who still served and one elected to fill the vacancy from the new district.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment instead requires that the vacancy must be filled from the district as it existed when the member who has died or resigned was elected.  It does so in the new language that specifies that any vacancy occurring during the terms being served in a redistricting year (2011, 2021, etc.) will be filled from the preexisting district, that is, the same district that elected the member whose vacancy is being filled.",Constitutional Amendment 1,Legislative Referendum,Redistricting,General,0.858,Amendment,1
2352,Virginia,2004,Succession to the Office of Governor,"The Constitution now provides for successors to serve as Governor or Acting Governor if the Governor dies, resigns, or cannot serve as Governor.  The present list of successors includes the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, and the Speaker of the House of Delegates, in that order.  If these listed officials cannot serve as Governor or Acting Governor, the House of Delegates then meets to elect a person to fill the vacancy in the office of Governor.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed constitutional amendment expands the list of persons who may serve as Acting Governor in the event of an emergency or enemy attack that prevents the House of Delegates from meeting to elect a person to fill the vacancy.<BR>  <BR>  The amendment adds to the list:  the person designated by the Rules of the House of Delegates to succeed the Speaker, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the majority leader of the Senate, in that designated order.  The successor would be Acting Governor until the House of Delegates convened to elect a Governor. The amendment also includes authority for the General Assembly, by law, to provide for a waiver of certain eligibility requirements for the Attorney General, Speaker, or acting Speaker to serve as Governor or acting Governor in the event of an emergency or enemy attack.<BR>  <BR>  The Secure Virginia Panel recommended on September 5, 2002, that the Constitution be amended to expand the list of possible successors to the office of Governor.  This Panel was created by Executive Order 7 (2002) to make recommendations for improving the Commonwealth's preparedness and ability to respond to disasters and emergencies of all kinds, including terrorist attacks.

2353,Virginia,2006,Exempt Property,"Shall Section 6 of Article X of the Constitution of Virginia be amended to authorize legislation to permit localities to provide a partial exemption from real property taxes for real estate with new structures and improvements in conservation, redevelopment, or rehabilitation areas?<BR>  <BR>  EXPLANATION<BR>  <BR>  Present Law<BR>  The Constitution now allows the General Assembly to give local governments the power to provide a partial exemption from real estate taxes as an incentive for property owners to make substantial improvements to existing structures by renovating, rehabilitating, or replacing those structures.<BR>  <BR>  The General Assembly has passed laws that give the governing bodies of counties, cities, and towns the authority to provide for partial exemptions from real estate taxes for rehabilitated, renovated, or replacement residential, hotel, motel, commercial, or industrial structures. See, for example, § 58.1-3220 of the Code of Virginia.<BR>  <BR>  Proposed Amendment<BR>  The proposed amendment would expand the possibilities for this type of tax relief or incentive. It authorizes the General Assembly to pass laws that will allow counties, cities, and towns to provide a partial exemption from real estate taxes for new structures and improvements located in a conservation, redevelopment or rehabilitation area.<BR>  <BR>  The 2006 General Assembly passed Senate Bill 358 to implement this constitutional amendment if it is approved by the voters. Senate Bill 358 would authorize local governing bodies to provide for the partial exemption from taxation of (i) new structures located in redevelopment or conservation areas or rehabilitation districts and (ii) other improvements to real estate located in redevelopment or conservation areas or rehabilitation districts. The artial exemption would be a percentage of the increase in assessed value as a result of the new structure or improvement or an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the construction cost of such structure or improvement. The local governing body would be allowed to establish criteria for qualifying real estate including, but not limited to, the square footage for new structures. Senate Bill 358 will become effective if the proposed constitutional amendment is approved.<BR>  <BR>  A ""yes"" vote on the proposed amendment will give the General Assembly authority to permit localities to provide a partial exemption from real property taxes for real estate with new structures and improvements in conservation, redevelopment, or rehabilitation areas and will give effect to Senate Bill 358.

This Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage. Nor shall this Commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another union, partnership, or other legal status to which is assigned the rights, benefits, obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.""?<BR>  <BR>  EXPLANATION<BR>  <BR>  Present Law<BR>  The Constitution does not define marriage. Under current statutory law in Virginia, persons who marry must have a license and be married by a licensed minister, judge, or other person authorized by law to perform marriages.  Present law prohibits marriages between certain individuals. For example, the law prohibits a marriage between a brother and sister, between a couple where one of the parties is married to someone else, and between couples of the same sex.<BR>  <BR>  In 1975, the General Assembly enacted a statute (present Code of Virginia § 20-45.2) that states ""A marriage between persons of the same sex is prohibited."" In 1997, the General Assembly added a sentence to § 20-45.2 that states that:Any marriage entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights created by such marriage shall be void and unenforceable.<BR>  <BR>  In 2004, the General Assembly passed a law to prohibit certain civil unions or other arrangements between persons of the same sex. That law (Code of Virginia § 20-45.3) states that:<BR>  <BR>  A civil union, partnership contract or other arrangement between persons of the same sex purporting to bestow the privileges or obligations of marriage is prohibited. Any such civil union, partnership contract or other arrangement entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights created thereby shall be void and unenforceable.<BR>  <BR>  Thus, civil unions or other arrangements which purport ""to bestow the privileges or obligations of marriage"" are prohibited by statute.<BR>  <BR>  Proposed Amendment<BR>  <BR>  If approved by the voters, this proposed amendment will become part of the Constitution of Virginia. The proposed amendment adds a definition of marriage as the ""union between one man and one woman"" to the Constitution's Bill of Rights and prohibits Virginia and its counties, cities, and towns from creating or recognizing any legal status by any name which is comparable to marriage.<BR>  <BR>  Marriage in the Commonwealth creates specific legal rights, benefits, and obligations for a man and a woman. There are other legal rights, benefits, and obligations which will continue to be available to unmarried persons, including the naming of an agent to make end-of-life decisions by an Advance Medical Directive (Code of Virginia §54.1-2981), protections afforded under Domestic Violence laws (Code of Virginia § 18.2-57.2), ownership of real property as joint tenants with or without a right of survivorship (Code of Virginia § 55-20.1), or disposition of property by will (Code of Virginia § 64.1-46).<BR>  <BR>  A ""yes"" vote on the proposed amendment will result in the addition of the proposed Section 15-A to Article I, the Bill of Rights.

Falwell v. Miller, 203 F.Supp.2d 624 (W.D.Va. 2002). The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when any other group can incorporate. It noted that the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision in its 1969 report had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid.<BR>  <BR>  Following the court's decision in 2002, the State Corporation Commission, which is charged with the duty of administering the corporate statutes of the Commonwealth, began routinely to grant certificates of incorporation to churches and religious denominations that filed for incorporation under Virginia law.<BR>  <BR>  The 2004 General Assembly established a joint subcommittee to study issues related to the incorporation of churches and other appropriate matters. Senate Joint Resolution 89 (2004). In the executive summary for its report, the joint subcommittee recommended the repeal of the provision quoted above.

2359,Virginia,2012,Eminent Domain,"<B>Current Constitution and Background.</B><BR>  Article I, Section 11 of the current Constitution prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public uses without just compensation. The power to take private property for public uses is known as the power of eminent domain. If a private property owner and the entity acquiring property for a public use cannot agree on the sale of the property, the property may be taken by eminent domain and the amount of just compensation is decided in a court proceeding.<BR>  <BR>  In a 2005 case from Connecticut, the United States Supreme Court upheld the taking of private property and its transfer to a private business for economic development purposes and also said that states could restrict the use of eminent domain (Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469). Two years later, the Virginia General Assembly enacted § 1-219.1 of the Code of Virginia and set limits on the use of eminent domain powers. For example, § 1-219.1 provides that no more private property may be taken than is necessary for the stated public use, that the public interest for the taking must outweigh any private gain, and that private property cannot be taken for certain primary purposes such as increasing the tax base, revenues, or employment.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Proposed Amendment.</B><BR>  The proposed constitutional amendment continues the approach and concepts set out in § 1-219.1. However, while limits in the Code can be amended by any future General Assembly, the proposed amendment, if approved by the voters, could only be changed by a future constitutional amendment approved by the voters.<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment includes the following:<BR>  - The right to private property is a ""fundamental"" right.<BR>  - The taking or damaging of private property must be for a ""public use.""<BR>  - No more property may be taken or damaged than is necessary for the stated public use.<BR>  - A ""public service company, public service corporation, or railroad exercises the power of eminent domain for public use when such exercise is for the authorized provision of utility, common carrier, or railroad services."" Elimination of a public nuisance may be a public use. It is not a public use if the ""primary use is for private gain, private benefit, private enterprise, increasing jobs, increasing tax revenue, or economic development.""<BR>  - Just compensation for property taken is expanded and defined to be ""no less than the value of the property taken, lost profits and lost access, and damages to the residue caused by the taking."" The terms ""lost profits"" and ""lost access"" are to be defined by the General Assembly, and it has done so by separate legislation that will become law if this proposed amendment is approved by the voters (Chapters 699 and 719, 2012 Acts of Assembly).<BR>  - The entity condemning property, known as the condemnor, has the burden to prove that the property is being taken for a public use.",Question 2,Legislative Referendum,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.8190000000000001,Amendment,1

This requirement means that, for most taxing districts, a new levy proposition must be submitted to the voters each year. The current language of the constitution has an exception allowing levy propositions of up to four years for support of the common schools. A levy proposition for the construction, modernization, or remodeling of school facilities may be submitted for up to a six-year period.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed amendment, if it is approved:<BR>  <BR>  The proposed amendment would add additional language to article VII, section 2 of the state constitution.

2385,Washington,2003,Ergonomics Regulations,"Concerns the repeal and future limitation of ergonomics regulations. This measure would repeal existing state ergonomics regulations and would direct the department of labor and industries not to adopt new ergonomics regulations unless a uniform federal standard is required.<BR>   <BR>  The law as it presently exists:<BR>  <BR>  The director of labor and industries has the authority to adopt rules governing safety and health standards for conditions of employment. Among the rules the director has adopted are ""ergonomics rules"" that address exposure to specific workplace hazards that the director has found can cause or aggravate work-related musculoskeletal disorders, such as tendinitis, carpaltunnel syndrome, and low back disorders. The rules apply to employers with jobs that have been identified as having a sufficient degree of risk to require ergonomics awareness education and job hazard analysis. These jobs have typical work activities that expose employees to risk factors such as prolonged awkward posture; highly repetitive motion; repeated impact; high hand force; moderate to high hand-arm vibration; or heavy, frequent or awkward lifting.<BR>  <BR>  The rules require employers to provide ""ergonomics awareness education"" to employees working in or supervising jobs that are exposed to certain levels of these hazards within 30 days of beginning their jobs and at least once every three years after that. This education includes information relating to the causes, symptoms, consequences, and common measures taken to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Employers whose employees are exposed to specific levels of these risk factors must also analyze those jobs to determine whether they create a substantial risk of work-related injury. If so, employers must change the way in which the work is performed until jobs are below certain risk criteria, to the degree technologically and economically feasible.<BR>  <BR>  The rules provide options that employers may use to analyze and reduce hazards of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Employers who reasonably determine that they do not have jobs involving the listed risk factors are not covered by the rule.<BR>  <BR>  The rules were adopted in 2000, but provide a timetable that phases in implementation. Depending on the type of industry and the size of the company involved, the rule requires implementation of the educational requirements by dates ranging from July 1, 2002, to July 1, 2005, and of the hazard reduction requirements by dates ranging from July 1, 2003, to July 1, 2006.",Initiative Measure 841,Initiative,Labor & Employment,General,0.535,Statutory,1
2386,Washington,2003,Filling Partisan County Vacancies,"The legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on filling vacancies in legislative and partisan county elective offices.  This amendment would permit newly-elected officers to take office early if the office falls vacant after the general election and the newly-elected officer is of the same political party as the former officer.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional provision as it presently exists:<BR>  <BR>  If a vacancy occurs in either house of the legislature, in a district entirely located within a single county, or if a vacancy occurs in a county elective office, the vacancy is filled by appointment by the county legislative authority (county council or board of county commissioners). The person appointed must be from the same district or county as the officer whose office has become vacant, and of the same political party. The county legislative authority chooses from a list of three persons nominated by the county central committee of the political party with which the former officer was affiliated when last elected to the office. If the members of the county legislative authority cannot agree on an appointment within 60 days after the vacancy, the governor makes the appointment from the same list of nominees. The person appointed serves until his or her successor is elected at the next general election and has qualified to serve.<BR>  <BR>  If a vacancy occurs in a position in either house of the legislature where the district includes territory in two or more counties, the vacancy is filled by joint action of the legislative authorities of the counties in which the district is located, and the nomination may be made by either the political party's state central committee or by joint action of the party's county central committees. The governor makes the appointment if the county legislators cannot agree.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed amendment, if it is approved:<BR>  <BR>  This measure would address the special circumstance in which a vacancy occurs after a general election at which a new officer has been elected for the next succeeding term in office, such as a vacancy created by the incumbent’s death or resignation after a successor has been elected to the next term in office but before the successor has actually taken office. If the newly-elected officer is of the same party as the previous incumbent, the newly-elected officer could take office for the remainder of the previous incumbent's term, as well as serving during the new term for which he or she has been elected.<BR>  <BR>  EXAMPLE: Senator A did not seek re-election, and on November 5, B was elected to the term beginning next January. If A resigns on November 15, and A and B are of the same political party, this constitutional amendment would permit B to finish A’s term as well as to serve during the term beginning in January.<BR>  <BR>  If the vacancy occurs at any other time, or if the previous incumbent and the newly-elected officer are not of the same political party, the existing system would still be used to fill the vacancy.",HJR 4206,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.8220000000000001,Amendment,1

2398,Washington,2006,Energy Resource Use by Certain Electric Utilities,"<B>Explanatory Statement </B><BR>  The law as it presently exists:<BR>  <BR>  Electricity is supplied in Washington by both privately-owned companies (investor-owned utilities) and by publicly-owned utilities (utilities owned by cities, public utility districts, and certain other local government units). Some of these utilities operate their own facilities for generating electricity (typically hydroelectric dams or coal- or gas-fired generators). Some of these utilities purchase some or all of their electrical power from other utilities, from private producers or sellers of power, or from regional governmental entities such as the Bonneville Power Administration.<BR>  <BR>  The state Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) regulates the rates and practices of investor-owned electric utilities serving customers in this state. Under existing law, the UTC is required to adopt and implement policies to provide financial incentives for energy efficiency programs, and may authorize utilities to issue conservation bonds for the construction, acquisition, and operation of conservation assets. Each investor-owned electric utility has conservation service tariffs that charge rates sufficient to recover from its customers the utility's cost of conservation investment.<BR>  <BR>  The UTC does not regulate publicly-owned electric utilities that serve customers in this state. These utilities are directly responsible to the voters in their service territories for their rates, services, and policies. Under existing law, cities operating electric utilities may issue bonds or otherwise borrow money for energy conservation purposes, and are required to develop conservation plans to assist the public in conserving energy. Public utility districts are subject to similar energy conservation planning requirements, and are also authorized to assist citizens by financing the acquisition and installation of materials and equipment for energy conservation purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed measure, if it becomes law:<BR>  Under existing law, electric utilities in this state are not obligated to meet any specific numeric targets for either energy conservation or use of renewable resources to produce power. The proposed measure would impose targets for energy conservation and use of eligible renewable resources on all electric utilities that serve more than 25,000 customers in this state.<BR>  <BR>  Energy conservation. By January 1, 2010, each such electric utility would be required to identify its ""achievable cost-effective conservation potential"" through 2019, and to update this assessment at least every two years. ""Conservation"" would mean ""reduction in electric power consumption resulting from increases in the efficiency of energy use, production or distribution.""  Each utility would be required to set an annual target consisting of a certain share of this achievable cost-effective conservation potential, and to meet that share of conservation. In determining whether a utility meets its annual conservation target, the utility could include the reduction in electric energy sold to retail customers which own and use a high-efficiency cogeneration facility to meet some of their own power needs.<BR>  <BR>  Renewable resources. Each utility would also be required to meet specific targets for using eligible renewable resources to produce electricity, stated as a percentage of the utility's load. ""Load"" refers to the total amount of electricity the utility sold that year to its retail customers. Examples of eligible renewable resources include wind farms, solar panels, and geothermal plants. With limited exceptions, use of fresh water by hydroelectric dams and plants is not included as an eligible renewable resource.<BR>  <BR>  Each utility would have to use renewable resources to serve at least three percent (3%) of its load by 2012 through 2015; nine percent (9%) of load by 2016 through 2019, and fifteen percent (15%) of load by 2020 and thereafter. A utility could comply with its annual renewable resource target by using the requisite amount of eligible renewable resources, by purchasing enough eligible renewable resource credits (or a combination of each), or by investing at least four percent (4%) of its total annual retail revenue requirement in renewable resources.<BR>  <BR>  Cost recovery, penalties, reporting and enforcement. An investor-owned utility would be entitled to recover from its customers all costs the utility prudently incurred to comply with the measure. Similarly, each publicly-owned utility would be expected to recover its cost of compliance from its customers.<BR>  <BR>  If a utility fails to comply with either the energy conservation or the renewable energy targets, it would have to pay a penalty in the amount of $50 for each megawatt-hour of shortfall. This penalty amount would be adjusted annually for inflation. Penalty payments would go into a special account, and could only be used for the purchase of renewable energy credits or for energy conservation projects at state and local government facilities or publicly-owned educational institutions.<BR>  <BR>  In each year beginning in June 2012, each utility would be required to report to the state Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development (CTED) on the utilitys progress in the preceding year in meeting the targets. The investor-owned utilities would supply the same information to the UTC. Each utility would be required to make these reports available to its customers.<BR>  <BR>  The UTC would be authorized to implement and enforce the measure as to investor-owned utilities, and to adopt rules accordingly. For publicly-owned utilities, CTED would be authorized to adopt procedural rules and documentation requirements; the state auditor would be responsible for auditing compliance with the measure; and the Attorney General's Office would be responsible for enforcement.",Initiative 937,Initiative,Energy & Electric Utilities,General,0.517,Statutory,1
2399,Washington,2006,Estate Tax,"<B>Explanatory Statement</B><BR>  The law as it presently exists:<BR>  Washington law currently imposes a tax on the transfer of an estate of a deceased person if the taxable value of the estate is at least 2 million dollars. The gross value of a deceased person's estate includes the value at the time of death of all of the deceased person's property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever it is located. The taxable estate is determined by subtracting two million dollars, and various deduction amounts allowed under state law, from the gross value of the estate. The value of certain qualified property, as described in the law, such as farmland and timberland, may be deducted from the taxable value of the estate if the property is passed to a family member of the deceased person and certain other requirements are satisfied. Thus, such farmland and timberland generally are not subject to Washington's estate tax.<BR>  <BR>  The Washington estate tax is computed according to a table in the law. The tax rates and tax amounts specified in the table are graduated to increase with the value of the taxable estate. The minimum tax rate is ten percent for taxable estates of up to one million dollars, and the tax rate increases to a maximum of 19 percent on the portion of the taxable estate over nine million dollars.<BR>  <BR>  The revenues from this estate tax, including penalties, interest, and fees, are deposited in the education legacy trust account. Money in the education legacy trust account may be used only for deposit into the student achievement fund, for expanding access to higher education, and other educational improvement efforts. The education legacy trust account is funded by the estate tax, a portion of the cigarette tax, and certain interest earnings on the account.<BR>  <BR>  Washington's estate tax is independent of any federal estate tax obligations, and is not affected by the payment of federal estate taxes.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed measure, if it becomes law:<BR>  This measure would repeal Washington's estate tax. The repeal would apply to the estates of persons dying on or after the effective date of the measure. The repeal would affect only the Washington estate tax. A deceased person's estate would still be subject to federal laws imposing federal estate tax. Repeal of the Washington estate tax would discontinue that source of revenue for the education legacy trust account.",Initiative 920,Initiative,Education: PreK-12,General,0.382,Statutory,0
2400,Washington,2006,Government Regulation of Private Property,"<B>Explanatory Statement</B><BR>  The law as it presently exists:<BR>  The state and local governments enact and enforce laws that affect the use of real property, including laws that impose restrictions on use or development of real property. These laws are subject to constitutional and statutory requirements that provide certain protections to private property owners.<BR>  <BR>  Washington's constitution requires state and local government to pay an owner of private property just compensation before taking or damaging private property for a public use, and in general prohibits government from taking private property for private use. The federal constitution provides similar protections. A common example of the requirement for just compensation occurs when government acquires private property to build a public road. The constitution requires government to pay fair market value for private property taken to build the road and for damages to private property used for the road building but not taken.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional requirement to pay just compensation also applies under limited circumstances to laws that restrict the use of private property. If the restriction completely eliminates the owner's economic use of real property, or if the restriction involves a physical intrusion onto the private property, then just compensation is generally required. Whether regulations or restrictions on use of real property otherwise amount to a taking or damaging of private property under the constitution (and thus require payment of just compensation) depends on the particular effects on property. A restriction on real property may require just compensation depending on the economic impact of the restriction on the property, how the restriction affects legitimate property uses and the property owner's reasonable investment-backed expectations, and whether the restriction reflects a reasonable means for achieving an important public objective.<BR>  <BR>  Under the state and federal constitutions, a property owner may bring an action for just compensation to obtain the fair market value of property taken or damaged by the government, if the government has not paid compensation. Under the Washington Constitution, the property owner may also bring an action to invalidate government action that is taking or damaging private property and there is no public use, only a private use.<BR>  <BR>  Under current state law, a property owner who has applied for a permit to use property may recover damages, attorney fees, and other costs where a state or local agency action on the permit application is arbitrary or capricious, or if the state or local agency does not act within time limits established by law. RCW 64.40. Under a variety of laws, a property owner may challenge state or local government restrictions on the use of property and obtain an agency review or judicial remedy if a restriction is not allowed under state or local laws. These statutory protections for property owners are in addition to the constitutional right to just compensation described above.<BR>  <BR>  Under current state law, state agencies and local governments are required to follow an orderly and consistent process using advice and education from the Attorney General's Office to evaluate proposed actions affecting the use of property and to avoid taking or damaging private property without just compensation. RCW 36.70A.370. The process applies to all state agencies and to those local governments that plan and regulate land uses under the Growth Management Act.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed measure, if it becomes law:<BR>  As described below, Initiative Measure 933 would require a government to consider and document certain factors prior to enacting laws regulating private property. The Measure would also require a government to pay compensation to private property owners to enforce restrictions ""damaging the use or value"" of private property as defined by the Measure, which would require compensation in circumstances in addition to those where the state or federal constitutions would require compensation. Development regulations could not prohibit legal uses existing on a parcel of property.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative Measure 933 would require state and local government agencies to consider and document certain matters prior to enacting an ordinance, regulation, or rule that may ""damage the use or value"" of private property. ""Private property"" is defined to include all real and personal property interests protected by the state and federal constitutions, including and not limited to interests in land, buildings, crops, livestock, mineral and water rights. In general, ""real property"" refers to land, interests in land, and things attached to the land; ""personal property"" includes all other property. Government would be required to consider and document several factors, including: (1) identifying the private property to be affected by a proposed action; (2) the purpose(s) to be served by the action and the connection between the action and its purpose(s); (3) the extent to which the action deprives property owners of uses of property, or interferes with a property owner's right to exclude others, to possess property, to enjoy property, or to dispose of property; (4) estimated compensation that would be required under the Measure for ""damaging the use or value of property""; and (5) alternative less restrictive means of accomplishing the governmental purposes, including voluntary cooperation.<BR>  <BR>  The Measure defines ""damaging the use or value of property"" as meaning ""to prohibit or restrict the use of private property to obtain benefit to the public the cost of which in all fairness and justice should be borne by the public as a whole,"" and includes examples of restrictions that would and would not result in ""damaging the use or value"" of private property, triggering the requirement for compensation.<BR>  <BR>  Under Initiative Measure 933, examples of government action ""damaging the use or value"" of property and requiring compensation would include enforcement of any ordinance, regulation, or rule to private property:<BR>  - Prohibiting or restricting the use or size, scope, or intensity of any use legally existing or permitted as of January 1, 1996;<BR>  - Regulating the use of tidegates, bulkheads, or structures reasonably necessary to protect private property, the operation and maintenance of irrigation structures, or how a private property owner responds to flooding, erosion, or fire conditions;<BR>  - Requiring a portion of real property to be left in a natural state or with no beneficial use to the owner, unless necessary to prevent immediate harm to human health and safety; or<BR>  - Prohibiting maintenance or removal of trees or vegetation.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative Measure 933 provides that enforcement of restrictions that apply equally to all property subject to a state or local agencys jurisdiction would not ""damage the use or value"" of private property, and so would not require compensation. Under the Measure, examples include:<BR>  - Restricting the use of property to prevent immediate threat to human health or safety;<BR>  - Requiring compliance with structural standards like building or fire codes to prevent harm from natural disasters like fire, flood, or earthquake;<BR>  - Limiting location of sex offender housing or adult entertainment;<BR>  - Requiring compliance with federal laws restricting chemical uses, with worker health and safety laws, and with worker wage and hour laws;<BR>  - Requiring compliance with ordinances establishing setbacks from neighboring property lines, but only if the setbacks were set before January 1, 1996.<BR>  <BR>  Under Initiative Measure 933, if a local or state agency decided to enforce or apply an ordinance, regulation, or rule ""damaging the use or value"" of property, the agency must first pay the property owner compensation, and an agency that chooses not to take such an action is not liable for paying the property owner. Compensation would be the amount by which the fair market value of affected property is decreased by application or enforcement of the ordinance, regulation, or rule, and the fair market value of any portion of the property required to be left in a natural state or without beneficial use. Compensation also would include the property owner's reasonable attorney fees to enforce compensation under the Measure.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative Measure 933 would not limit existing state or local government authority to waive or vary the requirements of existing laws. The Measure would prohibit an agency from charging a fee to consider whether to waive or vary a law to avoid paying compensation that would be required under the Measure.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative Measure 933 would amend current law to provide that ""development regulations"" could not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption. The term ""development regulations"" refers to controls placed on development or land use activities by a county or city such as zoning ordinances, critical areas ordinances, shoreline master programs, planned unit development ordinances, and subdivision ordinances.<BR>  [S]",Initiative 933,Initiative,Land Use/Property Rights,General,0.41200000000000003,Statutory,0
2401,Washington,2006,Increasing an Exemption from the Personal Property Tax,"Explanatory Statement<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional provision as it presently exists:<BR>  The state constitution and state statutes provide for a property tax based on the value of property. Property taxes apply to both real property (land, buildings, and permanent fixtures) and personal property (all other property that is not real estate). The amount of the tax is determined based upon the assessed valuation of the property. Certain personal property is exempt from tax, including household goods, furnishings and personal effects used by the owner, and most business merchandise. Personal property subject to property tax consists mainly of office furniture and business equipment, fixtures, and machinery.<BR>  <BR>  The state constitution authorizes the legislature to enact an additional statutory exemption for taxable personal property worth up to $3,000 owned by each individual who is a ""head of a family"" and the legislature has done so. An individual who is a ""head of a family,"" as defined by statute, and by rule of the Department of Revenue, qualifies for the exemption. A ""head of a family"" is defined to include a husband or wife, or a surviving spouse not remarried; any person receiving an old age pension under state laws; any citizen of the United States, over the age of sixty-five who has resided in Washington continuously for ten years; and other individuals who reside with and provide care and maintenance for family members, as defined. Corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships do not qualify for the exemption.<BR>  <BR>  When an individual who qualifies as a ""head of a family"" owns taxable personal property, the individual is entitled to an exemption of up to $3,000.<BR>  <BR>  The effect of the proposed amendment, if it is approved:<BR>  The proposed constitutional amendment would authorize the legislature to increase the maximum personal property tax exemption for taxable personal property owned by each ""head of a family"" from $3,000 to $15,000.<BR>  [CA]",HJR 4223,Legislative Referendum,Tax & Revenue,General,0.7979999999999999,Amendment,1
2402,Washington,2007,Establishment of a Budget Stabilization Account,"<B>The effect of the proposed amendment, if it is approved:</B><BR>  If approved, this amendment would add a new provision to the state constitution establishing a budget stabilization account in the state treasury. The legislature would be authorized to enact laws to carry out the purposes of this amendment. The constitutional amendment would require that 1% of ""general state revenue"" for each fiscal year be transferred into the budget stabilization account. ""General state revenue"" means all state money received in the treasury, with certain exceptions that include money from the ownership or operation of any facility, undertaking, or project; money received for restricted purposes; and money received from the sale of bonds. The legislature could appropriate additional amounts into the budget stabilization account if it so chooses.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional amendment would permit money to be appropriated from the budget stabilization account only in four circumstances. First, if the governor declares a state of emergency resulting from a catastrophic event that makes action by government necessary to protect life or public safety, then by a majority vote of each house of the legislature, money could be appropriated from the account to respond to that emergency. Second, if the official forecast for job growth in the state for any fiscal year is estimated to be less than 1%, then for that fiscal year, money could be appropriated from the account by a majority vote of each house of the legislature. Third, the legislature could appropriate money from the account at any time by favorable vote of at least three-fifths (60%) of the members of each house of the legislature. Fourth, if the balance in the budget stabilization account exceeds 10% of estimated general state revenues for that fiscal year, then by majority vote of each house, the legislature could appropriate any amount that exceeds 10% of estimated general state revenues, but solely for deposit in the education construction fund. Under existing statutes, unless approved by two-thirds majority of the legislature and the voters, funds in the education construction account may be appropriated only for common school and higher education construction.<BR>  <BR>  Under laws enacted by the legislature that would go into effect on July 1, 2008, and only if this proposed constitutional amendment is approved, the emergency reserve account statute would be repealed, and funds remaining in that account would be transferred to the budget stabilization account.",SJR 8206,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.677,,1
2403,Washington,2007,Health Insurance Referendum,"<B>The effect of the proposed measure, if approved:</B><BR>  This measure is a referral to the people of a bill (ESSB 5726) passed by the 2007 session of the legislature. The term ""this bill"" refers here to the bill as passed by the legislature.<BR>  <BR>  A vote to ""approve"" this bill is a vote to approve ESSB 5726 as passed by the legislature. A vote to ""reject"" this bill is a vote to reject ESSB 5726 as passed by the legislature.<BR>  <BR>  ESSB 5726 would amend the laws concerning unfair or deceptive insurance practices by providing that an insurer engaged in the business of insurance may not unreasonably deny a claim for coverage or payment of benefits to any ""first party claimant."" The term ""first party claimant"" is defined in the bill to mean an individual, corporation, association, partnership, or other legal entity asserting a right to payment as a covered person under an insurance policy or insurance contract arising out of the occurrence of the contingency or loss covered by such a policy or contract.<BR>  <BR>  ESSB 5726 would authorize any first party claimant to bring a lawsuit in superior court against an insurer for unreasonably denying a claim for coverage or payment of benefits, or violation of specified insurance commissioner unfair claims handling practices regulations, to recover damages and reasonable attorney fees, and litigation costs. A successful plaintiff could recover the actual damages sustained, together with reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs as determined by the court. The court could also increase the total award of damages to an amount not exceeding three times the actual damages, if the court finds that an insurer has acted unreasonably in denying a claim or has violated certain rules adopted by the insurance commissioner. The new law would not limit a court's existing ability to provide other remedies available at law. The claimant would be required to give written notice to the insurer and to the insurance commissioner's office at least twenty days before filing the lawsuit.<BR>  <BR>  ESSB 5726 would not apply to a health plan offered by a health carrier as defined in the insurance code. The term ""health carrier"" includes a disability insurer, a health care service contractor, or a health maintenance organization as those terms are defined in the insurance code. The term ""health plan"" means any policy, contract, or agreement offered by a health carrier to provide or pay for health care services, with certain exceptions set forth in the insurance code. These exceptions include, among other things, certain supplemental coverage, disability income, workers’ compensation coverage, ""accident only"" coverage, ""dental only"" and ""vision only"" coverage, and plans which have a short-term limited purpose or duration. Because these types of coverage fall outside the definition of ""health plan,"" ESSB 5726's provision would apply to these exceptions to ""health plans.""<BR>  <BR>  <B>Fiscal Impact Statement for Referendum 67</B><BR>  Referendum 67 is a referendum on ESSB 5726, a bill that would prohibit insurers from unreasonably denying certain insurance claims, permitting recovery up to triple damages plus attorney fees and litigation costs. This may increase frequency and amounts of insurance claims recovered by state and local government, the number of insurance-related suits filed in state courts, and increase state and local government insurance-premiums. Research offers no clear guidance for estimating the magnitude of these potential increases. Notice of insurance-related suits must be provided to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner prior to court filing, costing an estimated $50,000 per year.",Referendum Measure 67,Popular Referendum,Health,General,0.5670000000000001,,1

The amendment would provide that inmate labor programs operated by private entities shall not unfairly compete with Washington business, as determined by law. The term ""convicts"" would be changed to ""inmates"" in this provision.<BR>  <BR>  If this amendment is enacted, the legislature would continue to be obligated to provide for inmate labor programs for the benefit of the state, but would be permitted to include programs established by contract with the state under which private entities use inmate labor, as well as programs operated directly by the state.",SJR 8212,Legislative Referendum,Criminal Justice,General,0.607,,1

2406,Washington,2007,School District Tax Levies,"<B>The effect of the proposed amendment, if it is approved:</B><BR>  EHJR 4204 would amend Article 7, section 2, of the Constitution, to permit voter approval of a school district ""excess levy"" proposition by a majority of the voters voting on the proposition. In other words, the amendment would eliminate the 60% supermajority requirements based on the number of votes cast in the last general election in the district. The excess levy requirements would not change for levies by other local government bodies, and school districts would still be subject to the existing requirements concerning timing of levy elections. The amendments would also clarify that a proposition must be submitted not more than twelve months before the initial levy is to be made. The constitutional provisions permitting certain kinds of levies for up to four or six years would not be changed.<BR>  <BR>  EHJR 4204 would also make several minor amendments to Article 2, section 7, of the Constitution to conform the language to current legislation drafting style.

2407,Washington,2007,Tax and Fee Increases Imposed by State Government,"<B>The effect of the proposed measure, if it becomes law:</B><BR>  <BR>  The measure applies to the existing requirement that any action taken by the legislature that ""raises taxes"" must be approved by a two-thirds vote. Specifically, the measure would clarify that the term ""raises taxes"" includes any legislative action that increases state tax revenue deposited in any fund, budget, or account, but does not include revenue neutral tax shifts. The measure would recognize that the legislature may, if it chooses, submit a tax increase to the voters for their approval or rejection in a referendum.<BR>  <BR>  With limited exceptions, the measure would also require legislative approval for all new fees and fee increases. Agencies would no longer be authorized to increase fees by administrative action. For any bill introduced in the legislature raising taxes or fees, the measure would require the office of financial management to promptly determine and provide to the public and members of the legislature a ten-year projection of its cost to taxpayers, including a yearly projection. The cost projection would be required for each revenue source in any such bill. The measure would require that the office of financial management report the cost projection analysis in a press release to be posted on its website, including the names and contact information for the sponsors and co-sponsors of any such bill. When a legislative committee schedules a public hearing for a bill raising taxes or fees, the measure would require the office of financial management to promptly report the most recent cost projection analysis and provide notice of the hearing to legislators, the media, and the public. When a bill raising taxes or fees is approved by a legislative committee or a majority of members of either house of the legislature, the measure would require the office of financial management to expeditiously update the cost projection and report the updated analysis to the legislature, the media and the public. The office of financial management would be required to prioritize the preparation of cost projection analyses and reporting and dissemination of cost projection information for bills raising taxes or fees. Such projections would take priority over producing fiscal notes. The measure would require that whenever possible, the cost projection analysis be provided, along with the fiscal notes, prior to or at the time the bill or resolution is first heard by the applicable legislative committee. As with fiscal notes, the cost projection analysis for bills increasing taxes or fees would be attached to the bill or resolution throughout the legislative process insofar as possible.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would eliminate the current allowance for an increase in the state expenditure limit when the cost of a state program and related revenue are shifted to the general fund or a related fund from another fund or account if the revenue previously had been shifted from the general fund or a related fund.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would require an advisory vote of the people to be placed on the next general election ballot if legislative action raising taxes is not subject to a referendum vote. If such legislative action involves more than one revenue source, the measure requires that each tax increase would be subject to a separate advisory vote of the people. The measure would not require an advisory vote of the people if legislative action raising taxes is otherwise subject to a vote of the people.<BR>  <BR>  In order to implement the advisory vote, the measure would require the attorney general to determine legislative action that is subject to an advisory vote, send written notice to the secretary of state, and formulate a short description of each advisory vote measure. The measure would require county auditors to print advisory vote measures and their short description on the official ballots under a separate heading on the ballot entitled ""Advisory Vote of the People."" The measure would also require the general election voters' pamphlet to contain certain information about each advisory vote appearing on the ballot, including the short description written by the attorney general, the most recent ten-year cost projection analysis, each legislator's vote on final passage of the tax increase, and contact information for each legislator.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Summary of Fiscal Impact</B><BR>  Initiative 960 would result in added costs to prepare ten-year cost projections for proposed state tax and fee increases, to notify legislators and the public about proposed revenue legislation, and to conduct advisory votes on tax increases approved by the Legislature. Costs are estimated to be up to $1.8 million a year, including $1.2 million for local election expenses. Local government pays election costs in even-numbered years. The state pays a pro-rated share in odd-numbered years. Actual election costs for any particular year will depend on the number of tax measures referred to an advisory vote.",Initiative 960,Initiative,Legislatures,General,0.512,,1
2408,Washington,2008,Allowing Certain Terminally Ill Competent Adults to Obtain Lethal Prescriptions,"This measure would allow a terminally ill, competent, adult Washington resident who is medically predicted to have six months or less to live, to request and self-administer lethal medication prescribed by a physician. The attending physician with primary responsibility for care of the patient would be required to determine that the patient has an incurable, irreversible disease expected to cause death within six months; that the patient is competent; that the patient has demonstrated Washington residency; that the request is voluntary; and that the patient is making an informed decision. A second, consulting physician, would be required to confirm that the patient is terminally ill, competent, and has made an informed and voluntary decision. The measure defines competent as having the ability to make and communicate an informed decision to health care providers. The measure defines an informed decision as a qualified patient's decision to request and obtain a lethal prescription, based on an appreciation of the relevant facts and after being fully informed by the attending physician of his or her diagnosis, prognosis, the risks and probable result of ingesting the medication, and feasible alternatives.<BR>  <BR>  The attending physician would be required to recommend that the patient notify the patient's next of kin, but the patient would not be required to do so. If the attending or consulting physician believes the patient's judgment may be impaired by a psychiatric or psychological disorder or depression, the physician would be required to refer the patient to a psychiatrist or psychologist for counseling. Lethal medication could not be prescribed until the counselor determines that the patient’s judgment is not impaired. Immediately before writing the prescription, the attending physician would be required to verify that the patient is making an informed decision.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would require a patient to make one written and two oral requests to the attending physician for the lethal medication. The patient would have the right to rescind the request at any time, and in any manner, regardless of his or her mental state. The physician would be required to offer the patient an opportunity to rescind the request when the second oral request is made. A 15-day waiting period between the first and second oral requests would be required, and a 48-hour waiting period between the written request and the writing of the prescription would be required. The measure would require that the written request of the patient be substantially in a form contained in the measure. The form includes a statement that the patient is of sound mind and is making a voluntary request, has a terminal disease, has been informed of the likely effect of taking the lethal medication and feasible alternatives, that the patient understands the right to rescind the request at any time, and an indication of whether the patient's family has been informed.<BR>  <BR>  Two persons would be required to witness the patient's written request and to attest that, to the best of their knowledge, the patient is competent, acting voluntarily, and not being coerced. The measure would require that one witness not be a relative; not be the patient's attending physician; not be entitled to a portion of the patient's estate; and not own, operate, or be employed by a health care facility where the patient is a patient or resident. If the patient is an inpatient at a health care facility, one witness would be required to be designated by the facility. The measure would require attending physicians to document compliance with its requirements.<BR>  <BR>  Persons participating in good faith compliance with the measure, including being present when a qualified patient takes the prescribed lethal medication, would not be subject to criminal or civil liability, or professional disciplinary action. Any person who willfully alters or forges a request for lethal medication without the patient’s authorization, conceals or destroys a rescission with the intent to cause the patient's death, or coerces or exerts undue influence on a patient to request lethal medication or destroy a rescission, would be guilty of a class A felony.<BR>  <BR>  Provisions in wills, contracts, or agreements purporting to affect the ability to make or rescind a request for lethal medication would be invalid. Life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policies, and rates charged for them, could not be conditioned on or affected by making or rescinding a request for lethal medication. A qualified patient’s ingestion of lethal medication would have no effect on a life, health, or accident insurance or annuity policy.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would not require a health care provider or facility that is unable or unwilling, to provide a prescription for lethal medication. If a health care provider or facility is unable or unwilling to carry out a qualified patient's request for lethal medication, and the patient transfers his or her care to a new provider, the prior provider would be required to transfer a copy of the patient's relevant medical records to the new health care provider, upon the patient's request. With advance notice, a health care facility that chooses not to participate under this measure may prohibit other health care providers from participating on the facility's premises.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would not prevent a health care provider from participating in the measure while acting outside the provider's capacity as an employee or independent contractor. In addition, the measure would not authorize a health care provider or facility to sanction a physician or counselor for making an initial determination that a patient has a terminal disease; informing the patient of the medical prognosis; providing information about the measure at the patient's request; or providing information regarding this measure or a referral to another physician at the patient's request.<BR>  <BR>  State reports would refer to practices under the measure as obtaining and self-administering life-ending medication, and not as suicide or assisted suicide. The patient's death certificate would be required to list the underlying terminal disease as the cause of death.<BR>  <BR>  The state Department of Health would be required to annually review all records maintained under the measure and to adopt rules for collecting information relating to compliance with the measure. Health care providers that prescribe or dispense lethal medication under the measure would be required to file a report with the Department of Health. Information collected by the Department of Health would not be public. The Department of Health would be required to annually produce a public statistical report of collected information.<BR>  [S]",Initiative 1000,Initiative,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.578,,1
2409,Washington,2008,Long-Term Care Services for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities,"This measure would require that all long-term care workers for the elderly or disabled hired after January 1, 2010, be certified by the state Department of Health as a ""home care aide"" within 150 days of being hired. In order to receive this certification, the worker would be required to complete 75 hours of training as a home care aide and pass a certification examination.<BR>  <BR>  Long-term care workers would be required to satisfy the minimum training requirements proposed in the measure within 120 days of employment. All training curriculum would be approved by the state Department of Social and Health Services. The first five hours of the training would be completed before being eligible to provide care, including two hours of orientation to the role of the caregiver and three hours of safety training, including basic safety precautions, emergency procedures, and infection control. The remaining 70 hours would relate to basic training topics, including communication skills, worker self-care, problem solving, maintaining dignity, consumer directed care, cultural sensitivity, body mechanics, fall prevention, skin and body care, long-term care worker roles and boundaries, supporting activities of daily living, and food preparation and handling. The training must also address matters relating to specific populations, such as mental health, dementia, developmental disabilities, young adults with physical disabilities, and older adults. Individual providers must be paid for time spent in training.<BR>  <BR>  After completing training, the long-term care worker must pass an examination in order to be certified as a home care aide. The examination must include both a skills demonstration and a written or oral knowledge test.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would provide exceptions to the certification and training requirement. Certain nurses and nursing assistants and medicare-certified home health aides may receive certification by passing the examination without taking the training and, to the extent permitted by federal law, certain reciprocity would be required between home care aide certification and nursing assistant certification. People employed as long-term care workers prior to January 1, 2010, who have completed all current training requirements, would also be excused from obtaining certification. Also, individuals caring only for their own parent or child, and long-term care workers employed by supported living providers, need not be certified. Long-term care workers covered by the certification and training requirements do include only people paid by the State or by a private agency or facility licensed by the State to provide personal care services.<BR>  <BR>  All long-term care workers would be required to receive at least 12 hours of continuing education training each year in order to retain a certification. This annual continuing education requirement would not apply to a person caring only for his or her own child.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would affect part-time workers differently than full-time workers. Before January 1, 2014, a person working 20 hours or less providing care for one person in a calendar month would be required to receive 35 hours of training. Five of those hours must be completed before providing care, including two hours of orientation training and three hours of safety training. Part-time workers would also be excused from the annual continuing education requirement until January 1, 2014. The full training requirements of the measure would apply to these part-time long-term care workers as of January 1, 2014, and the certification requirement would apply as of July 1, 2014.<BR>  <BR>  The requirement that long-term care workers be screened through criminal background checks would be broadened for all workers hired after January 1, 2010. The background checks must include checking against FBI fingerprint identification records and against the national sex offender registry. The State would be required to pay the costs of these background checks.<BR>  <BR>  The measure also includes training requirements for people who receive payments from the State to provide care for certain family members. Those providing care for their own child or parent, other than to a developmentally-disabled child, must receive 35 hours of training. Five of those hours must be completed before providing any state-paid care, including two hours of orientation training and three hours of safety training. Parents who contract through the State to provide care for their developmentally disabled child would be required to receive 12 hours of training within the first 120 days of so contracting.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would also increase the requirement that the State offer advanced voluntary training for long-term care workers from 65 to 70 hours of voluntary advanced training, by January 1, 2011.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would prohibit the State from paying for long-term care services by providers who do not comply with the requirements of this measure. It would permit the State to terminate any contracts with providers, or take enforcement actions against providers, who fail to comply with the measure.

The measure would define the term ""peak hours"" to include the hours between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and the hours between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. All other hours would be defined as ""non-peak hours."" The measure would open all carpool lanes (as defined) during non-peak hours for use by all traffic otherwise lawfully abiding by the rules of the road. During peak hours, the use of carpool lanes would be limited to motor vehicles carrying two or more persons, or motorcycles carrying one or more persons. Tolls could not be charged on any vehicle in a high-occupancy toll lane during non-peak hours.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would require cities and counties to synchronize the traffic lights on heavily-traveled arterials and streets within their jurisdictions to optimize traffic flow.

2412,Washington,2009,"Concerns State, County and City Revenue","This measure would limit growth of certain state, county and city revenue to annual inflation and population growth, not including voter-approved revenue increases. Revenue collected above the limit would reduce property tax levies.<BR>  <BR>  <B>Explanatory Statement</B><BR>  <I>The Law as it Presently Exists</I><BR>  State and local governments receive revenue through taxes and fees. Some of the rates for these taxes and fees are set by elected representatives in the state Legislature, or in the case of certain local taxes, by local city councils, county councils, or boards of county commissioners. Local taxes may be imposed only if they are authorized by state law. The rates for taxes paid to the State of Washington are set in statute by the Legislature. The voters may also enact laws regarding taxes by initiative or, if applicable, by referendum. Some local taxes can only be imposed if the local voters approve them. State law also permits the assessment of certain fees by state or local agencies, as authorized by the Legislature.<BR>  <BR>  The State deposits much of the revenue that it receives from taxes and fees into the state general fund and into accounts referred to by the law as ""related funds."" Cities and counties place much of the revenue that they receive from taxes and fees into local ""current expense funds."" These funds are similar in nature to the State's general fund. State law limits spending from the State general fund and ""related funds"" to the prior year's expenditures from those funds, increased by the average growth in state personal income for the prior ten years. The spending limit does not apply to city and county expenditures.<BR>  <BR>  The state constitution and state statutes limit the maximum amount of revenue that state and local governments may collect from property taxes in a given year, and the amount that property taxes may be increased each year. The state constitution generally limits the total of all annual property tax levies on a particular property to no more than 1% of its true and fair value, unless voters approve higher property taxes. In addition, by statute, the total amount of money that any state or local jurisdiction receives from property taxes may only increase by 1% per year, or the rate of inflation. Total property tax revenue for each jurisdiction can only go up by more than this amount if the voters of that jurisdiction approve the increase by a majority vote. Property taxes for particular parcels may increase or decrease by more or less than that amount, depending on changes in assessed valuation or new construction. Property taxes are levied by both state and local governments. Local property taxes are levied by cities, counties, and special districts, either by the elected representatives or through voter approval of specific property tax levies.<BR>  <BR>  <I>The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved</I><BR>  This measure would limit the growth of revenue to the State's general fund and ""related funds,"" and to cities' and counties' local ""current expense funds,"" based on an annual rate of inflation and population growth. If the State or any city or county receives revenue in a given year above the revenue limit established by the measure, then it must deposit the revenues above the limit into a separate account, and reduce the amount that it otherwise would be authorized to levy in property taxes in the following year by that amount.<BR>  <BR>  The limit on revenue growth would not apply to revenue increases approved by the voters at an election, and money received from the federal government would not be included in the State's revenue limit. The inflation rate used to calculate the revenue growth limit would be based on the implicit price deflator for the United States. The limit on state general fund revenue also would be based on changes in statewide population, while for cities and counties it would be based on changes in population for each city and county. The revenue limit would be adjusted if the costs of any program or service are shifted to or from the state general fund or local current expense fund to another fund, or if revenue is transferred from the state general fund or local current expense fund to another fund.",Initiative 1033,Initiative,Budgets,General,0.42100000000000004,Statutory,0
2413,Washington,2010,Concerns Establishing a State Income Tax and Reducing Other Taxes,"This measure would tax ""adjusted gross income"" above $200,000 (individuals) and $400,000 (joint-filers), reduce state property tax levies, reduce certain business and occupation taxes, and direct any increased revenues to education and health.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  The state of Washington does not currently impose an income tax or an excise tax on the receipt of income. The state does impose a business and occupation (B&O) tax on the privilege of engaging in various business activities in the state such as manufacturing, selling, or providing services. Although there are some limited deductions, the tax is generally imposed on the gross income of the business. The law authorizes a credit against the tax that is taken on the tax return filed by the business. The credit reduces the amount of tax owed by the business.  For most businesses, the credit is $35 times the number of months covered by the tax return.  For a business that files a tax return once a year, covering twelve months, the maximum credit is $420 ($35 x 12).  For some businesses that provide services to their customers, the credit is $70 times the number of months covered by the tax return.  For such a business that files a tax return every month, the maximum credit that can be taken on the monthly return is $70.  If the tax exceeds the amount of the credit, the credit is reduced.  If the tax owed is more than twice the amount of the credit, the credit is eliminated.  The B&O tax is deposited in the state general fund.<BR>  <BR>  The state, cities, counties, and other local jurisdictions are authorized to impose a property tax in varying amounts. The property tax is a tax based on the value of an owner's taxable property. The state is authorized to impose a property tax for the support of the common schools. The state property tax is one component of the total property tax bill received by a property owner, which also includes property taxes levied by other authorized jurisdictions. The procedure for imposing the tax begins when the state levies the tax. The levy is the total amount of tax the state is authorized to collect. The levy is calculated based on certain constitutional and statutory requirements and limitations. Once the total amount of the state school levy is determined, it is divided by the value of all of the taxable property in the state to determine the rate of the tax. The rate of the property tax is also subject to certain constitutional and statutory requirements. The amount of state property tax a property owner pays is determined by multiplying the tax rate by the value of his or her taxable property. The state property tax is deposited in the state general fund and the student achievement fund for later distribution to the school districts.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved</B><BR>  If approved, this measure would impose an excise tax on the receipt of taxable income beginning in 2012. For a married individual filing a joint return with his or her spouse and for every surviving spouse, the tax would be as follows:<BR>  <BR>  a) For taxable income of $0-$400,000:  $0 tax<BR>  b) For taxable income of $400,001-$1,000,000:  tax of 5% of the amount above $400,000  c) For taxable income of $1,000,001 and above: tax of $30,000 plus 9% of the amount above  $1,000,000<BR>  <BR>  For every individual, other than a surviving spouse, who is not married, and for a married individual who does not file a joint return with his or her spouse, the tax would be as follows:<BR>  a) For taxable income of $0-$200,000:  $0 tax<BR>  b) For taxable income of $200,001-$500,000:  tax of 5% of the amount above $200,000  c) For taxable income of $500,001 and above: tax of $15,000 plus 9% of the amount above  $1,000,000<BR>  <BR>  This measure would also increase the credit against the B&O tax to $4,800 a year. If the tax exceeds the amount of the credit, the credit would continue to be reduced. If the tax owed is more than twice the amount of the credit, the credit would continue to be eliminated.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would also reduce the state property tax levy. The state levy would be calculated in the way it currently is, and that figure would be reduced by twenty percent. The reduced levy would be divided by the value of all of the taxable property in the state to determine the rate of the tax. The amount of state property tax a property owner pays would continue to be determined by multiplying the tax rate by the value of his or her taxable property. The twenty percent levy reduction would not apply to property taxes imposed by other jurisdictions.<BR>  <BR>  Before spending the revenue generated by the tax imposed by this measure, the state treasurer would be required to calculate the loss to the general fund resulting from the increase in the B&O tax credit and the reduction of the state property tax levy, and deposit the revenue generated by the new tax into the state general fund to replace the lost revenue.<BR>  <BR>  After the state treasurer has made the deposit to the general fund to replace the lost revenue, the additional revenue generated by the tax imposed by this measure would be deposited in a dedicated account in the state treasury. Seventy percent of the revenue deposited in this dedicated account would be deposited in the education legacy trust account.  Funds in the education legacy trust account may be used to enhance student achievement in grades K-12 by, for example, reducing class size, establishing special tutoring programs, or providing professional development for educators.  The funds may also be used to expand access to higher education. Thirty percent of the funds deposited in the dedicated account would be used to supplement the state's basic health plan, provide for state and local public health services, provide long-term care services for seniors and people with disabilities, and for other health services.<BR>  <BR>  The tax imposed by this measure would apply differently to residents and nonresidents of Washington. The tax is imposed on all of the taxable income of a resident. For a nonresident, the tax would be imposed on all the taxable income derived from sources within Washington. A resident of Washington would include an individual who lives in the state all year or claims Washington as his or her home for federal income tax purposes. It would also include an individual who considers Washington his or her residence, unless the individual does not maintain a permanent residence in Washington or any other place, and does not spend more than thirty days in Washington during the tax year. An individual who does not consider Washington his or her residence, but maintains a permanent residence in Washington and spends one hundred eighty-three (183) days in the state would be considered a resident unless the individual satisfies the Department of Revenue that he or she is only in Washington for temporary or transitory purposes.<BR>  <BR>  The tax imposed by this measure would apply to taxable income. Taxable income is adjusted gross income, as determined under the federal internal revenue code, less two adjustments set out in the measure. First, taxable income would not include income that is exempt from state income tax under federal law. Second, because a nonresident's adjusted gross income may include income derived from sources outside of Washington, the measure sets out requirements to calculate a nonresident's taxable income that is derived from sources within Washington.<BR>  <BR>  Employers would be required to withhold estimated tax and pay it to the Department of Revenue.  The amount withheld would be a credit against any tax due during the taxable year. An employer who collected the estimated tax and failed to pay it to the Department would be personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax, plus interest and a penalty. An employer who fails to collect the estimated tax would be personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax, unless the failure was due to a reasonable cause and not willful neglect. It would be a gross misdemeanor for an employer to appropriate or convert the estimated taxes withheld. An individual, who is required to make estimated tax payments under the internal revenue code, must also make estimated payments to the Department.<BR>  <BR>  Only married couples filing a joint return or a surviving spouse with taxable income in excess of $400,000 or an individual with taxable income in excess of $200,000 would be required to file a state tax return. If a married couple files a joint federal income tax return, they would be required to file a joint state tax return, unless one spouse is a Washington resident and the other is not. The date for filing the state tax return is the due date for the federal income tax return. The Department of Revenue would use the taxpayer's federal tax return as the main source of taxpayer information.  Individuals subject to the tax imposed by this measure would be required to keep records, and the Department of Revenue would be authorized to inspect those records.<BR>  <BR>  The Department of Revenue would be required to refund all taxes improperly paid or collected. State law governing the administration of other state taxes would also apply to the tax imposed by this measure. The Board of Tax Appeals would have jurisdiction over appeals relating to the taxes imposed by this measure.<BR>  <BR>  The provisions of the internal revenue code would apply unless they are inconsistent with this measure. The internal revenue code is the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the amendments in effect on January 1, 2010. The Department of Revenue is authorized to adopt rules under the Administrative Procedure Act. The rules should be consistent with the internal revenue code, to the extent possible without being inconsistent with this measure.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would provide that the tax imposed may not be increased for any income level without a majority vote of the legislature and approval of the voters in an election.",Initiative 1098,Initiative,Business & Commerce,General,0.359,Statutory,0
2414,Washington,2010,Concerns Industrial Insurance,"This measure would authorize employers to purchase private industrial insurance beginning July 1, 2012; direct the legislature to enact conforming legislation by March 1, 2012; and eliminate the worker-paid share of medical-benefit premiums.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law As It Presently Exists</B><BR>  The state has laws establishing a system of industrial insurance, administered by the Department of Labor & Industries.  With limited exceptions, this system provides medical benefits and other compensation to all employees who suffer illness, disability, or death resulting from employment-related injuries, without regard to questions of fault.  Based upon this system, the law prohibits employees from suing their employers for damages for work-related injuries, with limited exceptions.<BR>  <BR>  The Department of Labor & Industries administers an industrial insurance fund which pays the benefits to which injured employees are determined to be entitled.  The fund’s primary source of revenue is a system of insurance premiums paid into the fund by employers, at rates determined by the Department based on the individual claims experience of the employer, the claim history of particular classes of employers, and the need for revenue to pay the fund’s obligations.  Employees are assessed by their employers one-half of the amount the employer is required to pay for the medical benefit portion of premiums, with certain exceptions.  These amounts are deducted from the employees' pay.<BR>  <BR>  Under current law, every employer covered by the industrial insurance laws must either (1) participate in the state program administered by the Department of Labor & Industries or (2) qualify as a self-insured employer.  Self-insured employers qualify by satisfying the Department that they have sufficient financial ability to make prompt and certain payment of compensation and premium assessments charged against those employers.  Whether the employer participates in the state program or is self-insured, the Department reviews and decides all employee claims, subject to appeal to the board of industrial insurance appeals, and thereafter to superior court.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect Of The Proposed Measure If Approved</B><BR>  This measure would establish a third option for employers beyond either participating in the state industrial insurance fund or qualifying as self-insurers.  Beginning on July 1, 2012, employers could instead purchase industrial insurance from qualified private industrial insurance insurers.  Companies could qualify to issue industrial insurance policies through licensing and regulation by the state insurance commissioner.  Private industrial insurers would have the same rights and responsibilities under the industrial insurance laws as the Department of Labor & Industries, and claim decisions by private industrial insurers could be appealed in the same manner as claim decisions by the Department.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would create an industrial insurance administrative fund and would direct that appropriations be made to the fund to pay the expenses of the state insurance commissioner and the board of industrial insurance appeals in performing their responsibilities.  The measure would establish a joint legislative task force with members representing the legislature, employers, industrial insurers, and employees.  The task force would be directed to develop proposed legislation to conform current statutes to the provisions of this measure.  The measure states that the legislature would be required to adopt supplemental legislation implementing this measure by March 1, 2012.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would repeal language authorizing employers to assess their employees for one-half of the amount the employer is required to pay for the medical benefit portion of the premium, and to deduct these amounts from the employees' pay.

Each of these taxes produces revenue that is deposited into the state general fund for the general support of programs of state government.<BR>  <BR>  The sales tax is imposed on retail sales in the state. Sales of some products are exempt from the sales tax, including the sale of food and food ingredients. Until 2010, food and food ingredients included candy and bottled water. Consequently, candy and bottled water were exempt from the sales tax.<BR>  <BR>  In 2010, the legislature amended the law to remove candy from the sales tax exemption for food and food ingredients. Candy became subject to the sales tax effective June 1, 2010. Candy is defined as a preparation of sugar, honey, or other sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces. Candy does not include products that contain flour or require refrigeration.<BR>  <BR>  In 2010, the legislature amended the law to remove bottled water from the sales tax exemption for food and food ingredients. Bottled water became subject to the sales tax effective June 1, 2010, and ending July 1, 2013.  In 2010, the legislature also enacted a statutory amendment that the sales tax would continue to apply to bottled water after July 1, 2013, if the voters approve Referendum 52 at the November 2010 general election. Bottled water is water sold in sealed containers for human consumption. Bottled water sold for medical purposes or to people who do not otherwise have a readily available source of clean water remains exempt from sales tax.<BR>  <BR>  In 2010, the legislature enacted an excise tax on the sale of certain carbonated beverages sold in the state. The tax took effect July 1, 2010, and expires on July 1, 2013. The carbonated beverages subject to this tax are nonalcoholic beverages that are naturally or artificially carbonated, and contain caffeine, extracts, fruit juice, herbs, sweeteners, or syrup. The tax is calculated at the rate of two cents per twelve ounces, and is applied once, either at the wholesale or retail level. The tax does not apply to the first ten million dollars of carbonated beverages sold in the state by any bottler.<BR>  <BR>  The B&O tax is imposed on various business activities in the state, such as manufacturing, selling, or providing services. The rate of the tax varies, depending upon the type of activity in which the business engages. As a general rule, businesses engaged in manufacturing pay a tax at the rate of 0.484 percent of the value of the products they manufacture. Lower rates apply to some manufacturing activities.<BR>  <BR>  In 2010, the legislature amended statutes governing the B&O tax on manufacturing meat products.  For perishable meat products, the amendments apply a tax rate of 0.138 percent of the value of the manufactured product. For nonperishable meat products, the amendments apply a tax rate of 0.484 percent of the value of the manufactured product.<BR>  <BR>  In 2010, the legislature amended statutes governing the B&O tax on manufacturing fruit and vegetable products by canning, preserving, freezing, processing, or dehydrating fresh fruits or vegetables. Under the 2010 law, an exemption from the B&O tax for manufacturing fruit and vegetable products is limited to products that contain only fruits, vegetables, or both (and certain other substances such as water, sugar, salt, seasonings, preservatives, and similar substances). The exemption does not apply to manufacturing other products that contain fruits or vegetables as ingredients, which are consequently taxed at the rate of 0.484 percent of the value of the manufactured product. Under the 2010 law, when the exemption from B&O tax on manufacturing fruit and vegetable products expires on July 1, 2012, manufacturing fruit and vegetable products containing only fruits, vegetables, or both (and certain other substances such as water, sugar, salt, seasonings, preservatives, and similar substances) will be taxed at the rate of 0.138 percent of the value of the manufactured product. Manufacturing of other products that contain fruits or vegetables as ingredients are taxed at the rate of 0.484 percent of the value of the manufactured product.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect Of The Proposed Measure If Approved</B><BR>  The measure would repeal the 2010 law applying the sales tax to candy.

A ""surety"" is an individual or institution that agrees to guarantee that bail will be paid on behalf of a charged person if bail is forfeited. ""Bail"" is money or property pledged by a person charged with a criminal offense. When the charged person posts sufficient bail, he or she is released from custody pending a trial.<BR>  <BR>  The constitutional provision has been implemented by court rules. Under those rules, a court may require bail to support a promise that the person charged will appear for trial. A court also may require bail to assure that the charged person complies with release conditions imposed by the court. The court may impose release conditions where there is a substantial danger that the charged person will commit a violent crime, or seek to intimidate witnesses, or otherwise unlawfully interfere with the administration of justice unless the court imposes conditions on the accused person’s release. If the charged person does not appear for trial, or violates release conditions secured by bail, bail may be forfeited. The trial court sets the amount of bail in a given case.<BR>  <BR>  The class of cases in which bail currently may be denied under the constitution as it presently exists is capital offenses ""when the proof is evident or the presumption is great."" A ""capital offense"" is an offense for which the death penalty may be imposed if the person charged is convicted. Under court rules, a person charged with a capital offense shall not be released on bail unless the court finds that release conditions will reasonably assure that the accused will appear for trial, will not significantly interfere with the administration of justice, and will not pose a substantial danger to others.  In capital cases, if a risk of flight, interference, or danger is believed to exist, the court may detain the charged person for trial, without bail.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment if Approved</B><BR>  The proposed constitutional amendment would authorize courts to deny bail in an additional class of cases: offenses punishable by the possibility of life in prison where there is a showing by clear and convincing evidence of a propensity for violence that creates a substantial likelihood of danger to the community or any persons. The legislature would have authority to set limitations on the denial of bail in these cases.",HJR 4220,Legislative Referendum,Criminal Justice,General,0.846,Amendment,1
2420,Washington,2010,Jobs Act Bonds - $505 Million,"This bill would authorize bonds to finance construction and repair projects increasing energy efficiency in public schools and higher education buildings, and continue the sales tax on bottled water otherwise expiring in 2013.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law as it Presently Exists</B>  The State of Washington issues bonds as one way of borrowing money for various public purposes. Bonds are written agreements, under which the state agrees to pay the borrowed money back over a stated period of time, with interest. One type of bond is referred to as a ""general obligation bond,"" which means that the state promises to repay the bonds from its general revenues, rather than from a dedicated source of revenue. The state pledges its full faith and credit toward the repayment of general obligation bonds. The state constitution limits the amount of money the state can borrow, except for debt approved by the voters.<BR>  <BR>  The state receives revenue in the form of taxes, including the state sales tax. The sales tax currently applies to most purchases of bottled water. The law makes exceptions for bottled water that is sold for certain medical purposes, or to people who do not otherwise have a readily available source of clean water. Current law also provides that the application of the sales tax to bottled water will expire July 1, 2013, and after that date the sales tax will no longer apply to purchases of bottled water.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved</B><BR>  This measure asks the voters to approve the state’s issuance of general obligation bonds to pay for certain construction and repair projects to improve energy efficiency in public schools and in higher education buildings. The measure would authorize the state to borrow $505 million by issuing bonds to be repaid from future revenue.<BR>  <BR>  The money raised by selling the bonds would be deposited into the state treasury, and would be used to make financial grants to public school districts, public universities, colleges and community colleges, and other public agencies. The grants would be used to pay for capital improvements for energy, utility, and operational cost savings.<BR>  <BR>  Grants would be awarded on a competitive basis, based on applications explaining what particular projects applicants propose to use the money to achieve. Grants would be awarded in competitive rounds, with at least five percent of the money in each round awarded to small public school districts with fewer than one thousand students. Each project would be weighted, based on: (a) the availability of nonstate money to assist in funding the project; (b) the energy savings to be achieved by the project; and (c) how quickly the project could be ready to proceed. The dollar amounts awarded for each project would be determined in order to fund the maximum number of projects with the greatest energy and cost benefit. Only eight-five percent of projects for which applications are submitted could be funded in each round, until the last round.<BR>  <BR>  General state revenues would be used to repay the bonds. If the voters approve this measure, then an amendment to state law would take effect that removes the expiration date for applying the state sales tax to purchases of bottled water. This would have the effect of continuing the collection of sales tax on purchases of bottled water after July 1, 2013, when that tax would otherwise expire. This measure states that the legislature intends to increase state revenue in this way in order to pay for a portion of the costs of repaying the bonds authorized by this measure.",Referendum Bill 52,Legislative Referendum,Bond Measures,General,0.462,Statutory,0
2421,Washington,2010,State Debt Authority,"This amendment would require the state to reduce the interest accounted for in calculating the constitutional debt limit, by the amount of federal payments scheduled to be received to offset that interest.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  Article VIII, section 1, of the Washington Constitution authorizes the state to borrow money, by issuing bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness, to be repaid over time with interest. That provision of the state constitution also sets a limit on the aggregate debt the state may assume. The aggregate debt contracted by the state cannot exceed an amount for which the payments of principal and interest in any fiscal year exceed nine percent of the average general state revenues for the previous three fiscal years. ""General state revenues"" are defined to include all money received by the state treasury from any source, with certain exceptions. Not all state debt is subject to the debt limit.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment if Approved</B><BR>  The proposed amendment would not change the constitutional debt limit. It would modify the annual calculation used to determine whether the state's debt is within the constitutional limit. The amendment would require the state, in annually calculating the amount required for payment of interest on its general obligation debt, to subtract scheduled federal payments to be received each year in respect of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness. Under the constitution, the debt the state may issue is based in part on the total amount of the state’s annual principal and interest payments. Therefore, subtraction of federal payments to be credited against interest on the debt could affect the amount of aggregate debt that the state may incur.",SJR 8225,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.52,Amendment,1
2422,Washington,2011,"Concerning Liquor: Beer, Wine and Spirits (Hard Liquor)","Initiative Measure No. 1183 concerns liquor:  beer, wine, and spirits (hard liquor).<BR>  <BR>  This measure would close state liquor stores and sell their assets; license private parties to sell and distribute spirits; set license fees based on sales; regulate licensees; and change regulation of wine distribution.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  In Washington, the state sells and controls the distribution and sale of ""spirits."" The term ""spirits"" refers to alcoholic beverages also called ""hard liquor"" (whiskies, vodka, gin, etc.). Spirits include beverages containing distilled alcohol and wines exceeding twenty-four percent alcohol by volume. Spirits do not include lower alcohol content beverages such as flavored malt beverages, beer, or wines containing less than twenty-four percent alcohol by volume.<BR>  <BR>  In Washington, spirits are sold at retail at state-run liquor stores and at ""contract liquor stores."" Contract liquor stores are private businesses that sell spirits and other liquor under a contract with the state. Washington has approximately 165 state liquor stores and 160 contract liquor stores.<BR>  <BR>  The Washington State Liquor Control Board (""the Board"") operates the state liquor stores and oversees the contract liquor stores. Among its responsibilities, the Board regulates liquor advertising in the state. The Board, however, cannot advertise liquor sales.<BR>  <BR>  The Board sets the price for spirits sold at state-run and contract liquor stores based on the wholesale cost of the spirits, taxes, and a markup authorized by statute. The Board also collects the taxes imposed on the retail sale of spirits, and collects license fees and penalties. The proceeds received from the sale of spirits, the tax revenues on spirits, and license fees are distributed to cities, counties, and the state. Certain revenues are dedicated to funding programs addressing alcohol and drug abuse treatment and prevention.<BR>  <BR>  In Washington, manufacturers and suppliers of spirits may only sell spirits to the Board. The Board acts as the sole distributor of spirits sold in the state liquor stores and contract liquor stores, and sold by restaurants and certain other licensed sellers. Under a law effective June 15, 2011, the state must examine whether to lease the state's liquor distribution facilities to a private party, and whether such a lease would produce better financial returns for the state.<BR>  <BR>  Existing law allows private parties to sell or distribute alcoholic beverages that are not spirits, such as wine or beer. Wine and beer sellers are licensed by the state. There are different licenses for each of ""three tiers"" of the wine and beer business: (1) manufacturing; (2) distribution; and (3) retail sales. Existing law regulates the financial relationships and business transactions allowed between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. While there are some exceptions, retailers are allowed to purchase wine or beer only from distributors. Similarly, distributors are allowed to purchase only from manufacturers, with certain exceptions.<BR>  <BR>  Existing law requires wine and beer manufacturers and distributors to maintain published price lists and offer the same price to every buyer. This requirement of uniform pricing prevents manufacturers or distributors from selling wine or beer at discounted prices to select customers, such as a quantity discount or other business reason for a discount. Existing law also requires wine and beer retailers to receive all wine and beer at their retail store and to not take delivery or store wine or beer at a separate warehouse location.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</B><BR>  Initiative 1183 allows private parties to sell and distribute spirits, and alters the Liquor Control Board's powers and duties. It eliminates the Board's power to operate state liquor stores, to supervise the contract liquor stores, to distribute liquor, and to set the prices of spirits. Initiative 1183 directs the Board to close state liquor stores by June 1, 2012. It directs the Board to sell assets connected with liquor sales and distribution, and to sell at auction the right to operate a private liquor store at the location of any existing state liquor store. Initiative 1183 repeals a 2011 law that directed the state to examine the financial benefit of leasing the state liquor distribution facilities to a private party.<BR>  <BR>  Under Initiative 1183, qualifying private parties may obtain licenses to distribute spirits or to sell spirits at retail. A retail spirits license allows the retailer to sell spirits directly to consumers, and allows the sale of up to 24 liters of spirits for resale at a licensed premise, such as to a restaurant. Initiative 1183 allows private distributors to start selling spirits on March 1, 2012, and private retail spirits sales to start on June 1, 2012.<BR>  <BR>  To obtain a retail spirits license, a store must have at least 10,000 square feet of enclosed retail space in a single structure. However, Initiative 1183 also allows a retail spirits license for a store at the location of a former state liquor store or contract liquor store, even if the store is smaller than 10,000 square feet. It also allows smaller stores where there are no 10,000 square foot licensed spirits stores in the area. Initiative 1183 requires retail stores to participate in training their employees to prevent sales of alcohol to minors and inebriated persons.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative 1183 allows local governments and the public to provide input before issuance of a license to sell spirits. Initiative 1183 preserves local government power to zone and regulate the location of liquor stores.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative 1183 would not change the existing taxes on spirits. Initiative 1183 would require spirits retailers and distributors to pay license fees to the state. Retail stores would pay a fee of seventeen percent of gross revenues from spirits sales under the license, plus an annual $166 fee. Spirits distributors would pay an annual $1,320 fee, plus a percentage of gross revenues from spirits sales under the license. During the first two years of a spirits distributor license, the distributor license fee would be ten percent of the distributor's gross spirits sales. After two years, the spirits distributor fee would drop to five percent of the distributor's gross spirits sales.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative 1183 also requires that all persons holding spirits distributor licenses must have together paid a total of one hundred fifty million dollars in spirits distributor license fees by March 31, 2013. If the total license fees received from all distributor license holders is less than one hundred fifty million dollars, the Board must collect additional spirits distributor license fees to make up the difference. This additional fee would be allocated among the persons who held a spirits distributor license at any time before March 31, 2013.<BR>  <BR>  In addition to existing laws controlling the distribution of moneys received by the Board, a portion of fees from retail spirits licenses and spirits distributor licenses would be distributed to border areas, counties, and cities to enhance public safety programs.<BR>  <BR>  Initiative 1183 also changes laws that regulate the retailers, distributors, and manufacturers of wine. Initiative 1183 eliminates the requirement that distributors and manufacturers of wine sell at a uniform price, which would allow the sale of wine at different prices based on business reasons. Spirits could also be sold to different distributors and retailers at different prices. Beer manufacturers and distributors, however, would continue to be regulated by existing laws requiring uniform pricing. Under Initiative 1183, retailers could accept delivery of wine at a retail store or at a warehouse location. Under Initiative 1183, a store licensed to sell wine at retail may also obtain an endorsement allowing the store to sell to license holders who sell wine for consumption on the premise. For example, this would allow the store to sell wine to a restaurant that resells the wine by the glass or bottle to its customers.",Initiative 1183,Initiative,Business & Commerce,General,0.5870000000000001,Statutory,1

2426,Washington,2011,Concerning the Length of Time a Voter Must Reside in Washington to Vote for President and Vice President,"<B>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  The Washington Constitution currently contains two provisions relating to the length of time that a person must be a resident of Washington in order to vote. One of those provisions, article VI, section 1A, is inoperative because of court decisions and a more recent amendment to the other provision, article VI, section 1.<BR>  <BR>  Article VI, section 1, provides that all citizens who are at least eighteen years old are entitled to vote if they have lived in the state, county, and precinct for at least 30 days before the election. The second provision, article VI, section 1A, states that all citizens of the United States who become residents of Washington during a presidential election year may vote for the offices of president and vice president if they resided in Washington for at least 60 days before the election.<BR>   <BR>  The voters added article VI, section 1A, to the state constitution in 1966 as Amendment 46. At that time, article VI, section 1, of the state constitution required voters to reside in the state for a full year prior to voting and, in addition, required that they live in the county for 90 days and the city, town, ward, or precinct for 30 days before the election. Therefore, when section 1A was added to the constitution in 1966, it provided a more lenient residency requirement so that new residents of the state could vote for president and vice president after a shorter, 60-day period of residency.<BR>  <BR>  After the voters approved adding section 1A to the state constitution, the United States Supreme Court ruled that any requirement that voters live in a particular place longer than 30 days in order to vote is unconstitutional. Based upon that holding, the Washington Supreme Court held that the 90-day county and one-year state residency requirements stated in article VI, section 1, were unconstitutional. Washington voters then approved amending article VI, section 1, to read as it does today in order to conform to the court decisions, but this amendment did not repeal or change article VI, section 1A. Washington law therefore currently entitles all otherwise-qualified citizens to vote if they have resided within the state, county, and precinct for at least 30 days.<BR>    <BR>  Article VI, section 1A, remains part of the state constitution, but has no operative effect.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</B><BR>  This measure proposes to amend the state constitution to remove article VI, section 1A, from the state constitution. The state constitution would continue to entitle all otherwise-eligible citizens of the United States to vote if they have resided in Washington, and in their county and precinct, for at least 30 days before the election.",SJR 8205,Legislative Referendum,Elections,General,0.731,Amendment,1
2427,Washington,2012,Amending the Constitution to Include the Recommendations of the Commission on State Debt,"The Legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on implementing the Commission on State Debt recommendations regarding Washington's debt limit. This amendment would, starting July 1, 2014, phase-down the debt limit percentage in three steps from nine to eight percent and modify the calculation date, calculation period, and the term general state revenues.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  <BR>  Article VIII, section 1 of the Washington State Constitution establishes a limit on the amount of certain debt the state may assume. It does so by limiting the annual cost of principal and interest payments the state may agree to pay. When contracting for new debt, the state may not agree to annual payments of principal and interest that would raise the total annual payments of principal and interest above nine percent of the average of the prior three years of “general state revenues,” as defined by the Constitution.<BR>  <BR>  Article VIII, section 1 defines “general state revenues” to be used in calculating the state debt limit. In general, the term includes all state moneys received in the state treasury that are not dedicated to a specific use. Examples of state moneys that are not part of “general state revenues” include fees or revenues derived from state ownership or operation of projects or facilities; federal and private grant moneys dedicated to specific purposes; money in retirement system funds; and money received from taxes levied for specific purposes (such as the state property tax, which is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools).<BR>  <BR>  Not all state debt is subject to the debt limit in Article VIII, section 1. For example, bonds payable from the gas tax and motor vehicle license fees are excluded, as are bonds payable from income received from investing the Permanent Common School Fund.<BR>  <BR>  Article VIII, section 1 pledges the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state to the payment of debt created pursuant to the section.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</B><BR>  <BR>  The amendment would change the calculations for determining how much debt Washington may assume. First, it would reduce the percentage rate used in calculating the state debt limit, from 9.0 percent of “general state revenues,” as currently provided; to 8.5 percent starting July 1, 2014; 8.25 percent starting July 1, 2016; and 8.0 percent starting July 1, 2034. The amendment also would clarify that this percentage rate calculation is applied at the time the state enters into contracts to assume debt.<BR>  <BR>  Second, beginning July 1, 2014, the amount of new debt that may be contracted each year would be calculated based on the average of the prior six years of “general state revenues,” rather than the prior three years, as it is currently.<BR>  <BR>  Third, the amendment would change the definition of “general state revenues” to include the state property tax, starting July 1, 2014. This change would allow the state property tax to be included in “general state revenues” when calculating the debt limit. The state property tax is dedicated by statute to the support of common schools, and that dedication to schools would not be changed by the amendment.",SJR 8221,Legislative Referendum,Budgets,General,0.631,Amendment,1
2428,Washington,2012,Amending the Constitution to Provide Clear Authority to State Research Universities to Invest Funds as Authorized by Law,"The Legislature has proposed a constitutional amendment on investments by the University of Washington and Washington State University. This amendment would create an exception to constitutional restrictions on investing public funds by allowing these universities to invest specified public funds as authorized by the legislature, including in private companies or stock.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Constitutional Provision as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  <BR>  The state constitution generally limits the investment of state funds. Article VIII, sections 5 and 7 and article XII, section 9 prohibit the investment of state funds in the stocks and bonds of private companies, associations, or corporations. Previous constitutional amendments have made exceptions to these restrictions to permit the legislature to authorize investment of certain funds in private stocks and bonds. Funds that currently may be invested in private stocks and bonds include public pension and retirement funds, industrial insurance (workers’ compensation) funds, funds held in trust for persons with developmental disabilities, the permanent common school fund, and permanent higher education funds. Permanent higher education funds are funds primarily derived from the sale, lease, or management of lands granted by the United States to the State of Washington at statehood for educational purposes.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Amendment, if Approved</B><BR>  <BR>  If the amendment were adopted, it would create a new exception to the constitutional restrictions on investing public funds.

2429,Washington,2012,Concerning Civil Marriage and Domestic Partnerships,"The legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239 concerning marriage for same-sex couples, modified domestic-partnership law, and religious freedom, and voters have filed a sufficient referendum petition on this bill.<BR>  <BR>  This bill would allow same-sex couples to marry, preserve domestic partnerships only for seniors, and preserve the right of clergy or religious organizations to refuse to perform, recognize, or accommodate any marriage ceremony.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law As It Presently Exists</B><BR>  <BR>  Washington law currently provides that marriage is a civil contract between a male and a female, who are both at least eighteen years old and otherwise capable of marrying. The law prohibits marriage if the parties to the marriage are of the same sex or are closely related, or if a party to the marriage is already married to somebody else. A marriage is void if one of the parties is under age seventeen, unless a superior court judge waives the age requirement based on a showing of necessity. A marriage entered into in another state or jurisdiction is recognized as valid unless Washington law would have prohibited the marriage if it had been formed here.<BR>  <BR>  The state also currently maintains a domestic partnership registry. Two individuals of the same sex may enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if they meet certain requirements. Two individuals may also enter into a state-registered domestic partnership if at least one of them is over 62 years old. The other requirements for entering a domestic partnership are that the couple share a residence, are both at least eighteen years old, are not closely related, and neither is married or in a domestic partnership with anyone else. A legal union of two persons that was validly formed in another state or jurisdiction, and that is similar to a domestic partnership, is recognized as a domestic partnership in Washington.<BR>  <BR>  The same rights, responsibilities, and obligations that state law grants or imposes on married couples and their families also apply to state-registered domestic partners. The terms spouse, marriage, marital, husband, wife, widow, widower, next of kin, and family, when used in state statutes, apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships as well as to marital relationships and married persons. Similarly, laws about dissolution and invalidation of marriage apply equally to state-registered domestic partnerships. Gender-specific terms such as husband and wife used in any statute, rule, or other law are construed to be gender neutral, and applicable to individuals in state-registered domestic partnerships.<BR>  <BR>  The Washington Law Against Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This prohibition applies to employment, real estate transactions, credit transactions, insurance, and to the full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges of any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</B><BR>  <BR>  If approved, this measure would allow same-sex couples to marry. Other prohibitions on marriage, such as those based on age, being closely related, and already being married to somebody else would continue to apply. Marriage laws would apply without regard to gender. This measure specifies that gender-specific terms like husband and wife will be construed to be gender-neutral and will apply to spouses of the same sex.<BR>  <BR>  This measure provides that clergy are not required to perform or recognize any marriage ceremony. No religious organization, or religiously-affiliated educational institution, would be required to provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage. Clergy, religious organizations, and religiously-affiliated educational institutions would be immune from any civil claim or cause of action, including a claim or cause of action based on the Washington Law Against Discrimination, based on a refusal to perform or recognize any marriage, or to provide facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the performance of a marriage.<BR>  <BR>  State and local governments would be prohibited from basing actions relating to penalties, benefits, licenses, or contracts on the refusal of a religious organization to provide such accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods. State and local governments would be prohibited from basing actions relating to penalties, benefits, or contracts on the refusal of a person associated with a religious organization to solemnize or recognize a marriage. The measure does not change or affect existing law regarding the manner in which a religious or nonprofit organization may be licensed to provide adoption, foster care, or other child-placing services.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would also recognize, as valid in Washington, marriages between same-sex couples entered into in another state or jurisdiction and recognized as valid in that other state or jurisdiction, unless either party to the marriage was already married to a different person or the parties to the marriage are closely related. It would also recognize certain legal unions between two persons, other than marriages, entered into in another state or jurisdiction. This provision applies if the legal union provides substantially the same rights, benefits, and responsibilities as a marriage, but does not meet the definition of a domestic partnership in Washington. Washington law would then treat such couples as having the same rights and responsibilities as married spouses in this state, unless the relationship is otherwise prohibited by Washington law or the couple does not marry within one year of becoming permanent residents of Washington. Two individuals would not be prohibited from obtaining a marriage license in Washington on the basis that they validly entered into a legal union, other than a marriage, in another state or jurisdiction.<BR>  <BR>  After June 30, 2014, state-registered domestic partnerships would be available only to couples in which one partner is at least 62 years old. The parties to existing same-sex domestic partnerships may either get married or dissolve their domestic partnership. Same-sex domestic partnerships, in which neither party is over 62 years old, will be automatically converted into a marriage as of June 30, 2014, unless the parties either get married or dissolve the domestic partnership before that date. The Secretary of State would be required to send letters to each same-sex domestic partner advising of these changes.",Referendum 74,Popular Referendum,Civil & Constitutional Law,General,0.532,Statutory,1
2430,Washington,2012,Decriminalizes Marijuana,"Initiative Measure No. 502 concerns marijuana. This measure would license and regulate marijuana production, distribution, and possession for persons over twenty-one; remove state-law criminal and civil penalties for activities that it authorizes; tax marijuana sales; and earmark marijuana-related revenues.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  <BR>  It is a crime under both Washington and federal law to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana, or to involve a minor in a marijuana-related offense.<BR>  <BR>  State law generally makes these crimes felonies. People convicted of felonies can serve time in state prison. People who possess 40 grams or less of marijuana, however, commit a misdemeanor. It is also a misdemeanor to make, possess, or deliver any paraphernalia used to grow, store, conceal, or use marijuana. Those convicted of misdemeanors can serve up to 90 days in a local jail. Minors who grow, distribute, or possess marijuana can be punished through juvenile court.<BR>  <BR>  It is not a state law crime, however, to grow, distribute or possess marijuana with respect to certain medical uses or with respect to medical research, under certain conditions.<BR>  <BR>  Washington law also makes it illegal to drive under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug. State law provides that every person who drives in Washington has consented to a test to find out whether he or she has alcohol or any drug in his or her blood. The results of these tests can be used in criminal trials, and in proceedings to suspend, revoke, or deny a driver’s license. The state can also suspend, revoke, or deny the driver’s license of a person who refuses the test.<BR>  <BR>  Like state law, federal law also makes it a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana. People also commit a federal crime if they provide places for growing, distributing, or storing marijuana. It is also a federal crime to use a telephone to buy or sell marijuana. Federal law makes all of these crimes felonies, except that it makes possessing marijuana a misdemeanor. Like state law, federal law allows limited use of marijuana for medical research, but does not allow medical use of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  State law cannot modify the federal laws making it a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</B><BR>  <BR>  For persons over age 21, this measure would remove state law criminal and civil prohibitions with respect to growing, manufacturing, distributing, and possessing marijuana consistent with a state marijuana licensing and regulatory system.<BR>  <BR>  Without violating state law, people over age 21 could grow, distribute, or possess marijuana, as authorized under various types of licenses. People could only buy limited amounts of marijuana at a time, and possession of marijuana by people over age 21 in amounts that do not exceed that limit would not violate state law. It would still be a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana except by following the licensing and other requirements of this measure.<BR>  <BR>  A license to produce marijuana would make it legal under state law to grow marijuana. A license to process marijuana would make it legal under state law to process and package marijuana. It would also make it legal under state law to make products that contain marijuana. Licensed producers and processors could sell marijuana at wholesale, but could not sell marijuana at retail directly to consumers. Licensed retailers could sell marijuana, and products containing marijuana, to consumers at retail. Licensed retailers could also sell paraphernalia items used to store or use marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  It would cost $250 to apply for a license. It would also cost $1,000 every year to get and keep a license. A separate license would be required for each location. Locations could not be within 1,000 feet of any school, playground, recreation centers, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Producers and processors could not have any financial interest in any licensed marijuana retailer.<BR>  <BR>  It would still be a state law crime for a person under age 21 to grow, sell, or possess marijuana. It also would remain illegal under state law for anybody, including people who have licenses under this measure, to sell marijuana or products containing marijuana to people under 21 years old.<BR>  <BR>  Licensed marijuana retailers could not sell any products other than marijuana and items used to store or use marijuana. Licensed marijuana retailers could not allow people under age 21 on their premises. Signs posted by licensed marijuana retailers that are visible to the public would be limited in size and content. No marijuana could be displayed in a way that is visible from a public place. It would be illegal to open or consume any marijuana product on the premises. Licensed marijuana retailers could be fined for violations. This measure would prohibit any person from opening a package containing marijuana in public view.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would limit advertising of marijuana. Advertisements would need to be at least 1,000 feet away from any school, playground, recreation center, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Advertisements would be banned from buses and light rail, and from government property.<BR>  <BR>  The state could deny, suspend, or cancel licenses. Local governments could submit objections for the state to consider in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The state could inspect the premises of any license holder. Prior criminal conduct could be considered for purposes of granting, renewing, denying, suspending or revoking a license. The state could not issue a license to anybody under age 21. The state could adopt further rules to implement this measure.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would require licensed producers and processors to submit marijuana samples to an independent lab for regular testing. The state would receive test results. Marijuana that does not satisfy state standards would be destroyed.<BR>  <BR>  Sales of marijuana would be taxed. Marijuana excise taxes, in the amount of 25% of the selling price, would be collected on all sales of marijuana, at each level of production and distribution. Sale by a marijuana producer to a marijuana processor would be subject to a 25% tax. A sale by the processor to a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. Sales of marijuana by a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. State and local sales taxes would also apply to retail sales of marijuana.<BR>  <BR>  The measure directs the state to spend designated amounts from the marijuana excise taxes, license fees, penalties, and forfeitures for certain purposes. Those purposes include spending fixed dollar amounts on: administration of this measure; a survey of youth regarding substance use and other information; a cost-benefit evaluation of the implementation of this measure; and web-based public education materials about health and safety risks posed by marijuana use. Remaining money would be distributed as follows: 50% for the state basic health plan; 15% for programs and practices aimed at prevention or reduction of substance abuse; 10% for marijuana education; 5% for other health services; 1% for research on short-term and long-terms effects of marijuana use; and .75% for a program that seeks to prevent school dropouts. The remaining 18.25% would be distributed to the state general fund.<BR>  <BR>  This measure would also amend the law that prohibits driving under the influence. It would specifically prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana. Consent to testing to determine whether a driver’s blood contains alcohol or any drug would specifically apply to marijuana as well. State law that currently specifies a level of blood alcohol concentration for driving under the influence would be amended to also specify a level of the active ingredient in marijuana. A person who drives with a higher blood concentration of that active ingredient, or who is otherwise under the influence of marijuana, would be guilty of driving under the influence. For persons under 21, any level of the active ingredient of marijuana would be prohibited.<BR>  <BR>  Federal marijuana laws could still be enforced in Washington.",Initiative 502,Initiative,Drug/Alcohol/Tobacco Policy,General,0.555,Statutory,1

2433,Washington,2012,Public Charter Schools,"Initiative Measure No. 1240 concerns creation of a public charter school system. This measure would authorize up to forty publicly-funded charter schools open to all students, operated through approved, nonreligious, nonprofit organizations, with government oversight; and modify certain laws applicable to them as public schools.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Law as it Presently Exists</B><BR>  <BR>  The legislature has provided for the education of resident children through creation of a public school system. Public schools are operated by local school districts under the overall supervision of the state superintendent of public instruction. Children between the ages of eight and eighteen must attend public school, subject to certain exceptions including enrolling in private school or receiving homeschool instruction.<BR>  <BR>  School districts are local government bodies responsible for operating the “common schools” (kindergarten through twelfth grade) in their boundaries. A board of directors elected by the people of the district governs each school district. Each board appoints a superintendent of schools and employs teachers, administrators, and other staff as needed.  School district boards must comply with certain statewide standards, but each board is responsible for selecting the number, size, and location of school buildings, employing staff, and choosing curriculum and textbooks for that district.<BR>  <BR>  Each school district must allow all children residing within its geographic boundaries to enroll in its schools. Each school district has discretion to determine where an enrolled student attends school. Most districts assign students to schools on a geographic basis but may also offer students some choice of schools within a district. Many districts offer special programs that are available to students on a non-geographical basis. If agreed to by both districts, a student may attend school in another district.<BR>  <BR>  Currently, public schools are established by local school district boards and cannot be created or operated by any other entity. They are primarily funded by the state. The legislature appropriates funds to the superintendent of public instruction for distribution to school districts. District allotments consider a number of factors but are primarily based on the number of students enrolled in the district. In addition to their state funding, districts may levy voter-approved special property taxes and seek funding from the federal government and/or private sources for district educational programs.<BR>  <BR>  State laws impose various requirements for education programs offered by school districts. Examples of state requirements include provisions relating to student/teacher ratios, alternative education programs, special education, student transportation, bilingual instruction, highly capable students, visual and auditory screening of students, immunization, early childhood programs, school attendance, compulsory course work, food services for students, and management of school district property.<BR>  <BR>  The state board of education is a state agency made up of sixteen members, including the superintendent of public instruction, members appointed by the governor, and members elected by local school boards. The board of education develops educational policy and provides strategic oversight of the public school system.<BR>  <BR>  The Education Employment Relations Act (Chapter 41.59 RCW) governs school district employment relations issues. This statute provides for collective bargaining as to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, and sets requirements and limitations on the collective bargaining process. Collective bargaining matters are within the jurisdiction of the public employment relations commission, a state agency.<BR>  <BR>  <B>The Effect of the Proposed Measure, if Approved</B><BR>  <BR>  This measure would allow the authorization of a limited number of charter schools within the state’s public school system. The measure uses the terms “charter school” and “public charter school” interchangeably, and defines the term as a public school governed by a charter school board and operated according to the terms of a charter contract, which is entered into pursuant to the terms of the measure. The measure would limit the number of charter schools to forty over a five year period, with no more than eight charter schools established per year.<BR>  <BR>  A public charter school would include one or more of grades kindergarten through twelfth. Each charter school would be operated by a nonprofit corporation meeting the requirements of public benefit nonprofit corporations (a nonprofit corporation that has been designated as a tax-exempt charity under the federal internal revenue code). The nonprofit corporation could not be a sectarian or religious organization. Charter schools would be open to all students, and could only limit admission based on age group, grade level, or capacity of the school. Charter schools would be subject to supervision by the superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education.<BR>  <BR>  Public charter schools would be created either as “new” charter schools (public schools that did not previously exist) or “conversion” charter schools (existing public schools converted into charter schools). Conversion charter schools must enroll all students already attending the school who wish to remain enrolled. If new charter schools have insufficient capacity to enroll all students who apply, admission would be determined by lottery, with preference given to siblings of already enrolled students.<BR>  <BR>  The measure establishes two different ways that public charter schools could be authorized. First, the measure would create a new state agency, the Washington charter school commission. The commission could authorize charter schools anywhere in the state and enter into charter contracts with such schools. The commission would administer the charter schools it authorizes by managing, supervising, and enforcing the schools’ charter contracts. The commission would consist of nine members. The governor, the president of the state senate, and the speaker of the house of representatives would each appoint three members, and no more than five members could be of the same political party. The members would be required to have experience and expertise in public and nonprofit governance, public school education, and management and finance; and a demonstrated commitment to charter schools.<BR>  <BR>  Second, the measure would allow local school district boards to authorize public charter schools within their school district boundaries. To authorize charter schools, a school district board would first have to apply to the state board of education to be approved as an authorizer of charter schools. The measure sets minimum requirements for the application. An approved school district board would be required to execute a six-year contract with the board of education, agreeing to certain responsibilities as an authorizer. Approved school district boards could then authorize and enter into charter contracts with charter schools, and would be responsible for managing, supervising, and enforcing those charter contracts. The state board of education would oversee approved school district boards and under certain circumstances could revoke its approval of the school district board as an authorizer of charter schools.<BR>  <BR>  Under the measure, nonprofit corporations seeking to operate a public charter school would apply to the charter school commission or to an approved school district board. The measure sets minimum requirements for applications to operate charter schools. Applicants could apply to only one authorizer at a time, but could re-apply or apply to a different authorizer if rejected. The measure provides that preference would be given to approving applications for charter schools designed to enroll at-risk students.<BR>  <BR>  A public charter school’s basic structure and operations would be set forth in its charter contract. The charter contract would be a renewable, five-year contract between the authorizer (the state charter school commission or an approved local school board) and the charter school board. The charter school board would be appointed or selected according to the approved terms of the charter school application submitted by the nonprofit corporation. Subject to the terms of the charter contract, the charter school board could hire and discharge employees and enter into contracts to carry out the school’s functions, including purchase or rental of real property, equipment, goods, supplies, and services. Contracts for management of the charter school could only be with nonprofit corporations. The charter school board could also borrow money and issue debt, but could not use public funds allocated to the school as collateral. The state, the charter school commission, and the local school district would not be held responsible for the debt.<BR>  <BR>  The measure would set minimum requirements for what must be addressed in public charter school contracts, including academic and operational performance expectations and measures by which the performance will be judged. Charter contracts may be revoked or not renewed under certain circumstances, including failing to meet performance expectations.<BR>  <BR>  Public charter schools would receive allocation of state funding based on their student enrollments, including both basic education funding and other categories of state funding for public schools. A portion of this allocation would be used to fund administrative oversight by the authorizer of the charter school (the charter school commission or the local school district board).  Charter schools authorized by local school boards and conversion charter schools would also be entitled to per-pupil allocations of local levy proceeds, but new charter schools authorized by the charter school commission could receive funds only from levies submitted to voters after the school’s start-up date. A charter school would not be able to charge tuition, levy taxes, or issue tax-backed bonds. A charter school could accept and administer grants and donations from governmental and private entities, and would be eligible to apply for state grants on the same basis as a school district.<BR>  <BR>  Public charter schools would be exempt from most state statutes and rules applicable to school districts, except statutes and rules made applicable through the school’s charter. However, charter schools would be required to comply with certain laws such as local, state, and federal laws regarding health and safety, parents’ rights, civil rights, and nondiscrimination. Charter schools would be required to employ certificated instructional staff (with certain exceptions also applicable to other public schools), would be required to provide basic education as defined by statute, would be subject to performance audits, and would be subject to open public meetings and open public records laws. Charter schools would be prohibited from engaging in sectarian practices.<BR>  <BR>  Public charter schools and their employees would participate in state retirement programs for teachers, school employees, and public employee retirement systems, unless including them would jeopardize the status of the retirement systems as governmental plans for purposes of the internal revenue code and related federal laws. Charter school employees would also be eligible to participate in state employee health benefit programs.<BR>  <BR>  Public charter schools would generally be subject to the same collective bargaining requirements as other public schools, but the bargaining unit for collective bargaining would be limited to employees of the charter school rather than including employees from several schools or a school district.",Initiative 1240,Initiative,Education: PreK-12,General,0.508,Statutory,1
